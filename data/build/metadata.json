If there was no betting on a round because a player was all-in, the error should be corrected if discovered before the pot has been awarded. 7. If the flop needs to be redealt for any reason, the boardcards are mixed with the remainder of the deck. The burncard remains on the table. After shuffling, the dealer cuts the deck and deals a new flop without burning a card. [See \u201cSection 16 \u2013 Explanations,\u201d discussion #4, for more information on this rule.] 8. A dealing error for the fourth boardcard is rectified in a manner to least influence the identity of the boardcards that would have been used without the error. The dealer burns and deals\n\nwhat would have been the fifth card in the fourth card\u2019s place. After this round of betting, the\n\ndealer reshuffles the deck, including the card that was taken out of play, but not including the\n\nburncards or discards. The dealer then cuts the deck and deals the final card without burning\n\na card. If the fifth card is turned up prematurely, the deck is reshuff led and dealt in the same\n\nmanner.

Increasing the amount wagered by the opening forced bet up to a full bet does not count as a\n\nraise, but merely as a completion of the bet. For example: In $15-$30 stud, the lowcard opens\n\nfor $5.

In all fixed-limit games, when an open pair is showing on fourth street (second upcard), any player has the option of betting either the lower or the upper limit.

In limit play, the \u201csevens rule\u201d is assumed to be in use (the players should be alerted if it is not). If you check a seven or better and it is the best hand, all action after the draw is void,\n\nand you cannot win any money on any subsequent bets. You are still eligible to win whatever\n\nexisted in the pot before the draw if you have the best hand. If you check a seven or better\n\nand the hand is beaten, you lose the pot and any additional calls you make. If there is an all -\n\nin bet after the draw that is less than half a bet, a seven or better may just call and win that\n\nbet. However, if another player overcalls this short bet and loses, the person who overcalls\n\nreceives the bet back. If the seven or better completes to a full bet, this fulfills all obligations.\n\nDEUCE-TO-SEVEN LOWBALL\n\nIn deuce-to-seven lowball (sometimes known as Kansas City lowball), in most respects, the worst\n\nconventional poker hand wins. Straights and flushes count against you, crippling the value of a\n\nhand. The ace is used only as a high card. Therefore, the best hand is 7-5-4-3-2, not all of the same\n\nsuit. The hand 5-4-3-2-A is not considered to be a straight, but an ace-5 high, so it beats other ace-\n\nhigh hands and pairs, but loses to king -high. A pair of aces is the highest pair, so it loses to any\n\nother pair.\n\nThe rules for deuce-to-seven lowball are the same as those for ace-to-five lowball, except for the", "or better and it is the best hand, all action after the draw is void, and you cannot win any money on any subsequent bets.

Straights and flushes count against you, crippling the value of a hand. The ace is used only as a high card. Therefore, the best hand is 7-5-4-3-2, not all of the same suit. The hand 5-4-3-2-A is not considered to be a straight, but an ace-5 high, so it beats other ace- high hands and pairs, but loses to king -high. A pair of aces is the highest pair, so it loses to any other pair. The rules for deuce-to-seven lowball are the same as those for ace-to-five lowball, except for the following differences:\n\n1. The best hand is 7-5-4-3-2 of at least two different suits. Straights and flushes count against\n\nyou, and aces are considered high only.\n\n2. Before the draw, an exposed card of 7, 5, 4, 3, or, 2 must be taken. Any other exposed card\n\nmust be replaced (including a 6).\n\n3. Check-raise is allowed on any hand after the draw.\n\n4.

A full kill is double the\n\namount of the big blind, and doubles the betting limits. A half kill is one-and-a-half times the big\n\nblind, and increases the betting limits by that amount. A kill may be optional in a game, and is\n\noften used at lowball when a player wants to be dealt in right away instead of waiting to take the\n\nbig blind. A kill may be required in a game for any time a specified event takes place. In high-low\n\nsplit games using a required kill, a player who scoops a pot bigger than a set size must kill the next\n\npot. In other games using a required kill, a player who wins two consecutive pots must kill the next\n\npot. In this type of kill game, a marker called a \u201ckill button\u201d indicates which player has won the\n\npot, and the winner keeps this marker until the next hand is completed. If the player who has the\n\nkill button wins a second consecutive pot and it qualifies monetarily, that player must kill the next\n\npot.\n\nRULES OF KILL POTS\n\n1.

A full kill is double the amount of the big blind, and doubles the betting limits. A half kill is one-and-a-half times the big blind, and increases the betting limits by that amount. A kill may be optional in a game, and is often used at lowball when a player wants to be dealt in right away instead of waiting to take the big blind. A kill may be required in a game for any time a specified event takes place. In high-low split games using a required kill, a player who scoops a pot bigger than a set size must kill the next pot. In other games using a required kill, a player who wins two consecutive pots must kill the next pot. In this type of kill game, a marker called a \u201ckill button\u201d indicates which player has won the pot, and the winner keeps this marker until the next hand is completed. If the player who has the kill button wins a second consecutive pot and it qualifies monetarily, that player must kill the next pot. RULES OF KILL POTS 1.

All the rules for limit games apply to no-limit\n\nand pot-limit games, except as noted in this section. No-limit means that the amount of a wager is\n\nlimited only by the table stakes rule, so any part or all of a player\u2019s chips may be wagered. The\n\nrules of no-limit play also apply to po t-limit play, except that a bet may not exceed the pot size.\n\nThe player is responsible for determining the pot size at no -limit, not the dealer. The dealer is\n\nresponsible for determining the pot size at pot-limit, and should enforce the pot-size cap on wagers\n\nwithout waiting to be asked to do so by a player.

The number of raises in any betting round is unlimited. 2. The minimum bet size is the amount of the minimum bring-in, unless the player is going all- in. The minimum bring-in is the size of the big blind unless the structure of the game is preset by the house to some other amount (such as double the big blind). The minimum bet remains the same amount on all betting rounds. If the big blind does not have sufficient chips to post\n\nthe required amount, a player who enters the pot on the initial betting round is still required\n\nto enter for at least the minimum bet (unless going all-in for a lesser sum) and a preflop raiser\n\nmust at least double the size of the big blind. At all other times, when someone goes all-in for\n\nless than the minimum bet, a player has the option of just calling the all-in amount. If a player\n\ngoes all-in for an amount that is less than the minimum bet, a player who wishes to raise must\n\nraise at least the amount of the minimum bet. For example, if the minimum bet is $100, and a\n\nplayer goes all-in on the flop for $20, a player may fold, call $20, or raise to at least a total of\n\n$120.\n\n3. All raises must be equal to or greater than the size of the previous bet or raise on that betting\n\nround, except for an all -in wager. Example: Player A bets 100 and player B raises to 200.\n\nPlayer C wishing to raise mus t raise at least 100 more, making the total bet at least 300. A\n\nplayer who has already acted and is not facing a fullsize wager may not subsequently raise an\n\nall-in bet that is less than the minimum bet or less than the full size of the last bet or raise.", "blind does not have sufficient chips to post the required amount, a player who enters the pot on the initial betting round is still required to enter for at least the minimum bet (unless going all-in for a lesser sum) and a preflop raiser must at least double the size of the big blind.

For example, if the minimum bet is $100, and a player goes all-in on the flop for $20, a player may fold, call $20, or raise to at least a total of $120. 3. All raises must be equal to or greater than the size of the previous bet or raise on that betting round, except for an all -in wager. Example: Player A bets 100 and player B raises to 200. Player C wishing to raise mus t raise at least 100 more, making the total bet at least 300. A player who has already acted and is not facing a fullsize wager may not subsequently raise an all-in bet that is less than the minimum bet or less than the full size of the last bet or raise. (The half-the-size rule for reopening the betting is for limit poker only.)\n\n4. Multiple all-in wagers, each of an amount too small to qualify as a raise, still act as a raise\n\nand reopen the betting if the resulting wager size to a player qualifies as a rai se. Example:\n\nPlayer A bets $100 and Player B raises $100 more, making the total bet $200. If Player C goes\n\nall in for less than $300 total (not a full $100 raise), and Player A calls, then Player B has no\n\noption to raise again, because he wasn\u2019t fully rais ed. (Player A could have raised, because\n\nPlayer B raised.)\n\n14 NO-LIMIT AND POT-LIMIT\n\n38\n\n5. \u201cCompleting the bet\u201d is a limit poker wager type only, and not used at big-bet poker.\n\n6. At non-tournament play, a player who says \"raise\" is allowed to continue putting chips into\n\nthe pot with more than one move; the wager is assumed complete when the player\u2019s hands\n\ncome to rest outside the pot area. (This rule is used because no-limit play may require a large\n\nnumber of chips be put into the pot.) In tournament play, the TDA rules require that the player\n\neither use a verbal statement giving the amount of the raise or put the chips into the pot in a\n\nsingle motion, to avoid making a string-bet.\n\n7. A wager is not binding until the chips are actually released into the pot, unless the player has", "the betting is for limit poker only.) 4. Multiple all-in wagers, each of an amount too small to qualify as a raise, still act as a raise and reopen the betting if the resulting wager size to a player qualifies as a rai se. Example: Player A bets $100 and Player B raises $100 more, making the total bet $200. If Player C goes all in for less than $300 total (not a full $100 raise), and Player A calls, then Player B has no option to raise again, because he wasn\u2019t fully rais ed. (Player A could have raised, because Player B raised.) 14 NO-LIMIT AND POT-LIMIT 38 5. \u201cCompleting the bet\u201d is a limit poker wager type only, and not used at big-bet poker. 6. At non-tournament play, a player who says \"raise\" is allowed to continue putting chips into the pot with more than one move; the wager is assumed complete when the player\u2019s hands come to rest outside the pot area. (This rule is used because no-limit play may require a large number of chips be put into the pot.) In tournament play, the TDA rules require that the player either use a verbal statement giving the amount of the raise or put the chips into the pot in a single motion, to avoid making a string-bet. 7. A wager is not binding until the chips are actually released into the pot, unless the player has made a verbal statement of action.\n\n8. If there is a discrepancy between a player's verbal statement and the amount put into the pot,\n\nthe bet will be corrected to the verbal statement.\n\n9. If a call is short due to a counting error, the amount must be corrected, even if the bettor has\n\nshown down a superior hand.\n\n10. A bet of a single chip or bill without comment is considered to be the full amount of the chip\n\nor bill allowed. However, a player acting on a previous bet with a larger denomination chip\n\nor bill is calling the previous bet unless this player makes a verbal declaration to raise the pot.\n\n(This includes acting on the forced bet of the big blind.)\n\n11. If a player tries to bet or raise less than the legal minimum and has more chips, the wager must\n\nbe increased to the proper size (but no greater). This does not apply to a player who has\n\nunintentionally put too much in to call.\n\n12. Because the amount of a wager at big-bet poker has such a wide range, a player who has taken\n\naction based on a gross misunderstanding of the amount wagered may receive some protection\n\nby the decision-maker. A \"call\" or \u201craise\u201d may be ruled not binding if it is obvious that the\n\nplayer grossly misunderstood the amount wagered, provided no damage has been caused by", "unless the player has made a verbal statement of action. 8.

Because the amount of a wager at big-bet poker has such a wide range, a player who has taken action based on a gross misunderstanding of the amount wagered may receive some protection by the decision-maker. A \"call\" or \u201craise\u201d may be ruled not binding if it is obvious that the player grossly misunderstood the amount wagered, provided no damage has been caused by that action. Example: Player A bets $300, player B reraises to $1200, and Player C puts $300\n\ninto the pot and says, \u201ccall.\u201d It is obvious that player C believes the bet to be only $300 and\n\nhe should be allowed to withdraw his $300 and reconsider his wager. A bettor should not\n\nshow down a hand until the amount put into the pot for a call seems reasonably correct, or it\n\nis obvious that the caller understands the amount wagered. The decision -maker is allowed\n\nconsiderable discretion in ruling on this type of situation. A possible ru le-of-thumb is to\n\ndisallow any claim of not understanding the amount wagered if the caller has put eighty\n\npercent or more of that amount into the pot.\n\n14 NO-LIMIT AND POT-LIMIT\n\n39\n\nExample: On the end, a player puts a $500 chip into the pot and says softly, \u201cFour hundred.\u201d\n\nThe opponent puts a $100 chip into the pot and says, \u201cCall.\u201d The bettor immediately shows\n\nthe hand. The dealer says, \u201cHe bet four hundred.\u201d The caller says, \u201cOh, I thought he bet a\n\nhundred.\u201d In this case, the recommended ruling normally is that the bettor had an oblig ation\n\nto not show the hand when the amount put into the pot was obviously short, and the \u201ccall\u201d can\n\nbe retracted. Note that the character of each player can be a factor. (Unfortunately, situations", "wagered, provided no damage has been caused by that action.

Note that the character of each player can be a factor. (Unfortunately, situations can arise at big-bet poker that are not so clear-cut as this.)\n\n13. All wagers may be required to be in the same denomination of chip (or larger) used for the\n\nminimum bring-in, even if smaller chips are used in the blind structure. If this is done, the\n\nsmaller chips do not play except in quantity, even when going all-in.\n\n14. Since all a player\u2019s chips may be put at risk on a hand, the house has the right to set a maximum\n\namount for the buy-in to help control the effective size of a game.\n\n15. In non-tournament games, one optional live straddle is allowed. The player who posts the\n\nstraddle has last action for the first round of betting and is allowed to raise. To straddle, a\n\nplayer must be on the immediate left of the big blind, and must post an amount twice the size\n\nof the big blind. A straddle bet sets a new minimum bring-in; it is not treated as a raise.\n\n16. In all no-limit and pot-limit games, the house has the right to place a maximum time limit for\n\ntaking action on your hand. The clock may be put on someone by the dealer as directed by a\n\nfloorperson, if a player requests it. If the clock is put on you when you are facing a bet, you\n\nwill have one additional minute to act on your hand. You will have a ten -second warning,\n\nafter which your hand is dead if you have not acted.", "All wagers may be required to be in the same denomination of chip (or larger) used for the minimum bring-in, even if smaller chips are used in the blind structure.

The\n\nmanagement declines to make decisions in such matters, and the pot will be awarded to the\n\nbest hand. Players are asked to refrain from instigating proposition wagers in any form. The\n\nplayers are allowed to agree to deal twice (or three times) when someone is all -in. \u201cDealing\n\ntwice\u201d means the pot is divided in two, with each portion being dealt for separately.\n\n14 NO-LIMIT AND POT-LIMIT\n\n40\n\nPOT-LIMIT RULES\n\nA bet may not exceed the pot size. The maximum amount a player can raise is the amount in t he\n\npot after the call is made. Therefore, if a pot is $100, and someone makes a $50 bet, the next player\n\ncan call $50 and raise the pot $200, for a total wager of $250.\n\n1. If a wager is made that exceeds the pot size, the surplus will be given back to the bettor as\n\nsoon as possible, and the amount will be reduced to the maximum allowable.\n\n2. The dealer or any player in the game can and should call attention to a wager that appears to\n\nexceed the pot size (this also applies to heads-up pots).

The maximum amount a player can raise is the amount in t he pot after the call is made. Therefore, if a pot is $100, and someone makes a $50 bet, the next player can call $50 and raise the pot $200, for a total wager of $250. 1. If a wager is made that exceeds the pot size, the surplus will be given back to the bettor as soon as possible, and the amount will be reduced to the maximum allowable. 2. The dealer or any player in the game can and should call attention to a wager that appears to exceed the pot size (this also applies to heads-up pots). The oversize wager may be corrected at any point until all players have acted on it. 3. If an oversize wager has stood for a length of time with someone considering what action to take, that person has had to act on a wager that was thought to be a certain size. If the player\n\nthen decides to call or raise, and attention is called at this late point to whether this is an\n\nallowable amount, the floorperson may rule that the oversize amount must stand (especially\n\nif the person now trying to reduce the amount is the person that made the wager).\n\n4. In pot-limit play, it is advisable in many structures to round off the pot size upward to produce\n\na faster pace of play. This is done by treating any odd amount as the next larger size. For\n\nexample, if the pot size was being kept track of with $25 units, then a pot size of $80 would\n\nbe treated as a pot size of $100.\n\n5. In pot-limit hold\u2019em and pot-limit Omaha money games, many structures treat the little blind\n\nas if it were the same size of the big blind in computing pot size. In such a structure, a player\n\ncan open for a maximum of four times the size of the big blind. For example, if the blinds are\n\n$5 and $10, a player may open with a raise to $40. (The range of options is to either open with\n\na call of $10, or raise in increments of five dollars to any amount from $20 to $40.) Subsequent\n\nplayers also treat the $5 as if it were $10 in computing the pot size, until the big blind is", "was thought to be a certain size. If the player then decides to call or raise, and attention is called at this late point to whether this is an allowable amount, the floorperson may rule that the oversize amount must stand (especially if the person now trying to reduce the amount is the person that made the wager). 4. In pot-limit play, it is advisable in many structures to round off the pot size upward to produce a faster pace of play. This is done by treating any odd amount as the next larger size. For example, if the pot size was being kept track of with $25 units, then a pot size of $80 would be treated as a pot size of $100. 5. In pot-limit hold\u2019em and pot-limit Omaha money games, many structures treat the little blind as if it were the same size of the big blind in computing pot size. In such a structure, a player can open for a maximum of four times the size of the big blind. For example, if the blinds are $5 and $10, a player may open with a raise to $40. (The range of options is to either open with a call of $10, or raise in increments of five dollars to any amount from $20 to $40.) Subsequent players also treat the $5 as if it were $10 in computing the pot size, until the big blind is through acting on the first betting round. This rule of treating the little blind as if it were the\n\nsize of the big blind is especially desirable in a structure where the little blind uses a lower -\n\ndenomination chip than the big blind, as in using blinds of $10 and $25 (two $5 chips and a\n\n$25 chip). At tournament play, strict pot-limit rules are normally used, so there the maximum\n\nopening wager is 3.5 times the size of the big blind.\n\n6. In pot-limit, a player who puts a chip or a bill larger than the pot size into the pot without\n\ncomment is considered to be making a bet of the pot size (unless he is facing a bet).\n\n41\n\nSECTION 15 - TOURNAMENTS\n\nBy participating in a tournament, you agree to abide by the rules and behave in a courteous manner.\n\nA violator may be verbally warned, suspended from play for a specified length of time, or\n\ndisqualified from the tournament.

It is important to track where your bankroll stands at all times. * **Slow and steady** \u2013 Building a bankroll can take time unless you manage to win a tournament for a large score. Slow and steady wins the race when it comes to building a poker bankroll. * **Take advantage of bonuses** \u2013 Welcome bonuses and promotions can give your bankroll a shot in the arm. Check out PokerNews' online poker reviews for the best online poker bonuses. * **Treat your bankroll like an investment** \u2013 Treat your poker playing like a business so that you value every decision. Pretend you cannot reload your account, and see if you can nurture your bankroll to dizzy heights. * **Game select carefully** \u2013 There is no point being the sixth best poker player on the planet if you continually play against the top five players. Choose your games and tables wisely. If there isn't a fish or two in your game, swap tables.

After the last downcard is dealt, there is a final round of betting. The best five -card poker hand wins the pot. In all fixed -limit games, the smaller bet is wagered on the first two betting rounds, and the larger bet is wagered after the betting rounds on the fifth, sixth, and seventh cards. If there is an open pair on th e fourth card, any player has the option of making the smaller or larger bet. Deliberately changing the order of your upcards in a stud game is improper because it unfairly misleads the other players. RULES OF SEVEN-CARD STUD 1. The first round of betting starts with a forced bet by the lowest upcard by suit. On\n\nsubsequent betting rounds, the high hand on board initiates the action (a tie is\n\nbroken by position, with the player who received cards first acting first).\n\n2. The player with the forced bet has the option of opening for a full bet.\n\n3. Increasing the amount wagered by the opening forced bet up to a full bet does not\n\ncount as a raise, but merely as a completion of the bet. For example: In $15 -$30\n\nstud, the lowcard opens for $5. If the next player inc reases the bet to $15\n\n(completes the bet), up to three raises are then allowed when using a three -raise\n\nlimit.\n\n4. In all fixed -limit games, when an open pair is showing on fourth street (second\n\nupcard), any player has the option of betting either the lower or the upper limit. For\n\nexample: In a $5 -$10 game, if you have a pair showing and are the high hand, you\n\nmay bet either $5 or $10. If you bet $5, any player then has the option to call $5,\n\nraise $5, or raise $10. If a $10 raise is made, then all other rai ses must be in\n\nincrements of $10. If the player high with the open pair on fourth street checks, then\n\nsubsequent players have the same options that were given to the player who was\n\nhigh.", "betting starts with a forced bet by the lowest upcard by suit. On subsequent betting rounds, the high hand on board initiates the action (a tie is broken by position, with the player who received cards first acting first). 2. The player with the forced bet has the option of opening for a full bet. 3. Increasing the amount wagered by the opening forced bet up to a full bet does not count as a raise, but merely as a completion of the bet. For example: In $15 -$30 stud, the lowcard opens for $5. If the next player inc reases the bet to $15 (completes the bet), up to three raises are then allowed when using a three -raise limit. 4. In all fixed -limit games, when an open pair is showing on fourth street (second upcard), any player has the option of betting either the lower or the upper limit. For example: In a $5 -$10 game, if you have a pair showing and are the high hand, you may bet either $5 or $10. If you bet $5, any player then has the option to call $5, raise $5, or raise $10. If a $10 raise is made, then all other rai ses must be in increments of $10. If the player high with the open pair on fourth street checks, then subsequent players have the same options that were given to the player who was high. 5. If your first or second holecard is accidentally turned up by the dealer, then your\n\nthird card will be dealt down. If both holecards are dealt up, you have a dead hand\n\nand receive your ante back. If the first card dealt faceup would have been the\n\nlowcard, action starts with the first hand to that player\u2019s left. That play er may fold,\n\nSEVEN-CARD STUD\n\n22\n\nopen for the forced bet, or open for a full bet. (In tournament play, if a downcard is\n\ndealt faceup, a misdeal is called.)\n\n6. If you are not present at the table when it is your turn to act on your hand, you\n\nforfeit your ante and your forced b et, if any. If you have not returned to the table in\n\ntime to act, the hand will be killed when the betting reaches your seat.\n\n7. If a hand is folded when there is no wager, that seat will continue to receive cards\n\nuntil the hand is killed as a result of a bet.\n\n8. If you are all in for the ante and have the lowcard, the player to your left acts first.\n\nThat player may fold, open for the forced bet, or open for a full bet.\n\n9. If the wrong person is designated as low and that person bets, the action will be\n\ncorrected to the true lowcard if the next player has not yet acted. The incorrect\n\nlowcard takes back the wager and the true lowcard must bet. If the next hand has", "third card will be dealt down.

If a hand is folded when there is no wager, that seat will continue to receive cards until the hand is killed as a result of a bet. 8. If you are all in for the ante and have the lowcard, the player to your left acts first. That player may fold, open for the forced bet, or open for a full bet. 9. If the wrong person is designated as low and that person bets, the action will be corrected to the true lowcard if the next player has not yet acted. The incorrect lowcard takes back the wager and the true lowcard must bet. If the next hand has acted after the incorrect lowcard wager, the wager stands, action continues from\n\nthere, and the true lowcard has no obligations.\n\n10. If you pick up your upcards without calling when facing a wager, this is a fold and\n\nyour hand is dead. This act has no significance at the showdown because betting is\n\nover; the hand is live until discarded.\n\n11. A card dealt off the table must play and it is treated as an exposed card.\n\n12.

If the dealer burns two cards for one round or fails to burn a card, the cards will be\n\ncorrected, if at all possible, to t heir proper positions. If this should happen on a final\n\ndowncard, and either a card intermingles with a player's other holecards or a player\n\nlooks at the card, the player must accept that card.\n\n14. If the dealer burns and deals one or more cards before a r ound of betting has been\n\ncompleted, the card(s) must be eliminated from play. After the betting for that round\n\nis completed, an additional card for each remaining player still active in the hand is\n\nalso eliminated from play (to later deal the same cards to the players who would\n\nhave received them without the error).

After the betting for that round is completed, an additional card for each remaining player still active in the hand is also eliminated from play (to later deal the same cards to the players who would have received them without the error). After that round of betting has concluded, the dealer burns a card and play resumes. The removed cards are held off to the side in the event the dealer runs out of cards. If the prematurely deal t card is the final\n\nSEVEN-CARD STUD\n\n23\n\ndowncard and has been looked at or intermingled with the player's other holecards,\n\nthe player must keep the card, and on sixth street betting may not bet or raise\n\n(because the player now has all seven cards).\n\n15. If there are not enough cards left in the deck for all players, all the cards are dealt\n\nexcept the last card, which is mixed with the burncards (and any cards removed\n\nfrom the deck, as in the previous rule). The dealer then scrambles and cuts these\n\ncards, burns again, and delive rs the remaining downcards, using the last card if\n\nnecessary. If there are not as many cards as players remaining without a card, the\n\ndealer does not burn, so that each player can receive a fresh card.

The draw is completed to each player in order, and then the exposed card is replaced. 9. Rapping the table in turn constitutes either a pass or the declaration of a pat hand that doe s not want to draw any cards, depending on the situation. A player who indicates a pat hand by rapping the table, not knowing the pot has been raised, may still play his or her hand. 10. You may not change your seat between hands when there are multiple an tes or forfeited money in the pot. 11.

A pair of jacks or better is required to open the pot. If no player opens the pot, the button moves forward and each player must ante again, unless the limit of antes\n\nhas been reached for that particular game.

Any player who has legally declared the pot opened must prove openers in order to\n\nwin the pot.\n\n4. In all cases, the pot will play (even if the opener shows or declares a fouled hand) if\n\nthere has been a raise, two or more players call the opening bet, or all action is\n\ncompleted before the draw.\n\n5.

In all cases, the pot will play (even if the opener shows or declares a fouled hand) if there has been a raise, two or more players call the opening bet, or all action is completed before the draw. 5. Even if you are all in for just the ante (or part of the ante), you may declare the pot open if you have openers. If you are all in and falsely declare the po t open, you will\n\nlose the ante money and may not continue to play on any subsequent deals until a\n\nwinner is determined. Even if you buy in again, you must wait until the pot has been\n\nlegally opened and someone else has won it before you can resume playing.\n\n6. Once action has been completed before the draw, the opener may not withdraw\n\nany bets, whether or not the hand contains openers.\n\n7.

The joker may be used only as an ace, or to complete a straight, flush, or straight\n\nflush. (Thus it is not a completely wild card.)\n\n3. If the joker is used to make a flush, it will be the highest card of the flush not\n\npresent in the hand.\n\n4.

A full kill is\n\ndouble the amount of the big blind, and doubles the betting limits. A half kill is on e-and-\n\na-half times the big blind, and increases the betting limits by that amount. A kill may be\n\noptional in a game, and is often used at lowball when a player wants to be dealt in right\n\naway instead of waiting to take the big blind. A kill may be required in a game for any\n\ntime a specified event takes place. In high-low split games using a required kill, a player\n\nwho scoops a pot bigger than a set size must kill the next pot. In other games using a", "draw, if you call the opener\u2019s bet and cannot beat openers, you will not get your bet back. (You have received information about opener\u2019s hand that is not free.) THE JOKER 1. The players will be alerted as to whether the joker is in use. 2. The joker may be used only as an ace, or to complete a straight, flush, or straight flush. (Thus it is not a completely wild card.) 3. If the joker is used to make a flush, it will be the highest card of the flush not present in the hand. 4. Five aces is the best possible hand (four aces and joker). 37 SECTION 13 - KILL POTS To kill a pot means to post an overblind that increases the betting limit. A full kill is double the amount of the big blind, and doubles the betting limits. A half kill is on e-and- a-half times the big blind, and increases the betting limits by that amount. A kill may be optional in a game, and is often used at lowball when a player wants to be dealt in right away instead of waiting to take the big blind. A kill may be required in a game for any time a specified event takes place. In high-low split games using a required kill, a player who scoops a pot bigger than a set size must kill the next pot. In other games using a required kill, a player who wins two consecutive pots must kill the next pot. In this type\n\nof kill game, a marker called a \u201ckill button\u201d indicates which player has won the pot, and\n\nthe winner keeps this marker until the next hand is completed. If the player who has the\n\nkill button wins a second consecutive pot an d it qualifies monetarily, that player must kill\n\nthe next pot.\n\nRULES OF KILL POTS\n\n1. The kill button is neutral (belonging to no player) if:\n\n(a) It is the first hand of a new game.\n\n(b) The winner of the previous pot has quit the game.\n\n(c) The previous pot was split and neither player had the kill button.\n\n2. In a kill pot, the killer acts in proper turn (after the person on the immediate right).\n\n3. There is no pot -size requirement for the first pot or \"leg\" of a kill. For the second\n\n\"leg\" to qualify for a kill, you must win at least one full bet for whatever limit you are\n\nplaying, and it cannot be any part of the blind structure.\n\n4. If a player with one \"leg up\" splits the next pot, that player still has a \"leg up\" for the\n\nnext hand. If the player who spli t the pot was the kill in the previous hand, then that\n\nplayer must also kill the next pot.\n\n5.

For the second \"leg\" to qualify for a kill, you must win at least one full bet for whatever limit you are playing, and it cannot be any part of the blind structure. 4. If a player with one \"leg up\" splits the next pot, that player still has a \"leg up\" for the next hand. If the player who spli t the pot was the kill in the previous hand, then that player must also kill the next pot. 5. A person who leaves the table with a \u201cleg up\u201d toward a kill still has a \u201cleg up\u201d upon returning to the game. 6. A player who is required to post a kill must do so that same hand even if wishing to\n\nquit or be dealt out. A player who fails to post a required kill blind will not be allowed\n\nto participate in any game until the kill money is posted.\n\nKILL POTS\n\n38\n\n7. Kill blinds are considered part of the pot. If a player with a requi red kill wins again,\n\nthen that player must kill it again (for the same amount as the previous hand).\n\n8. When a player wins both the high and the low pot (\u201cscoops\u201d) in a split -pot game\n\nwith a kill provision, the next hand will be killed only if the pot is a t least five times\n\nthe size of the upper limit of the game.\n\n9. If you are unaware that the pot has been killed and put in a lesser amount, If it is a\n\nrequired kill pot with the kill button faceup, you must put in the correct amount. If\n\nnot, you may withdraw the chips and reconsider your action.\n\n10. In lowball, an optional rule is allowing players to look at their first two cards and\n\nthen opt whether to kill the pot. The pot may no longer be killed if any player in the\n\ngame has received a third card. In ord er to kill the pot voluntarily, you must have at\n\nleast four times the amount of the kill blind in your stack. For example: If the big\n\nblind is two chips, and the kill blind is four chips, the voluntary killer must have at", "to post a required kill blind will not be allowed to participate in any game until the kill money is posted.

The pot may no longer be killed if any player in the game has received a third card. In ord er to kill the pot voluntarily, you must have at least four times the amount of the kill blind in your stack. For example: If the big blind is two chips, and the kill blind is four chips, the voluntary killer must have at least 16 chips prior to posting th e kill. If this rule is used, it is in conjunction with\n\nhaving the killer act last on the first betting round rather than in proper order.\n\n11. Only one kill is allowed per deal.\n\n12. A new player is not entitled to play in a killed pot, but may do so by agr eeing to kill\n\nthe next pot.\n\n13. Broken game status is allowed only for players of the same limit and game type.\n\nFor this purpose, a game with a required kill is considered a different type of game\n\nthan an otherwise similar game without a required kill.\n\n39\n\nSECTION 14 - NO LIMIT AND POT-LIMIT\n\nA no-limit or pot-limit betting structure for a game gives it a different character from limit\n\npoker, requiring a separate set of rules in many situations.

All the rules for limit games apply to no -limit and pot -limit game s, except as noted in this section. No -limit means that the amount of a wager is limited only by the table stakes rule, so any part or all of a player\u2019s chips may be wagered.

For those rules that apply only to no -limit and pot-limit lowball, see the sub-section at the end of \u201cSection 11 \u2013 Lowball.\u201d NO-LIMIT RULES 1. The number of raises in any betting round is not limited. 2. All bets must be at least eq ual to the minimum bring -in, unless the player is going\n\nall-in. (A straddle bet sets a new minimum bring-in, and is not treated as a raise.)\n\n3. All raises must be equal to or greater than the size of the previous bet or raise on\n\nthat betting round, except for an all-in wager. A player who has already checked or\n\ncalled may not subsequently raise an all -in bet that is less than the full size of the\n\nlast bet or raise. (The half -the-size rule for reopening the betting is for limit poker\n\nonly.)\n\nExample: Player A bets $100 and Player B raises $100 more, making the total bet\n\n$200. If Player C goes all in for less than $300 total (not a full $100 raise), and\n\nPlayer A calls, then Player B has no option to raise again, because he wasn\u2019t fully\n\nraised. (Player A could have raised, because Player B raised.)\n\n4. A wager is not binding until the chips are actually released into the pot, unless the\n\nplayer has made a verbal statement of action.\n\n5. If there is a discrepancy between a player's verbal statement and the amount pu t\n\ninto the pot, the bet will be corrected to the verbal statement.\n\n6.

If a call is short due to a counting error, the amount must be corrected, even if the bettor has shown down a superior hand. 7. Because the amount of a wager at big -bet poker has such a wide range, a player\n\nwho has taken action based on a gross misunderstanding of the amount wagered\n\nNO-LIMIT AND POT-LIMIT\n\n40\n\nneeds some protection.

The decision -maker is allowed considerable\n\ndiscretion in ruling on this type of situation. A possible rule -of-thumb is to disallow\n\nany claim of not understanding the amount wagered if the caller has put eighty\n\npercent or more of that amount into the pot.\n\nExample: On the end, a player puts a $500 chip into the pot and says softly, \u201cFour\n\nhundred.\u201d The opponent puts a $100 chip into the pot and says, \u201cCall.\u201d The bettor\n\nimmediately shows the hand. The dealer says, \u201cHe bet f our hundred.\u201d The caller\n\nsays, \u201cOh, I thought he bet a hundred.\u201d In this case, the recommended ruling\n\nnormally is that the bettor had an obligation to not show the hand when the amount\n\nput into the pot was obviously short, and the \u201ccall\u201d can be retracted.

A player who says \"raise\" is allowed to continue putting chips into the pot with more\n\nthan one move; the wa ger is assumed complete when the player\u2019s hands come to\n\nrest outside the pot area. (This rule is used because no -limit play may require a\n\nlarge number of chips be put into the pot.)\n\n9. A bet of a single chip or bill without comment is considered to be the full amount of\n\nthe chip or bill allowed. However, a player acting on a previous bet with a larger\n\ndenomination chip or bill is calling the previous bet unless this player makes a\n\nverbal declaration to raise the pot. (This includes acting on the forced bet of the big\n\nblind.)\n\n10.

The player who posts the straddle has last action for the first round of betting and is allowed to\n\nNO-LIMIT AND POT-LIMIT\n\n41\n\nraise. To straddle, a player must be on the immediate left of the big blind, and must\n\npost an amount twice the size of the big blind.\n\n13. In all no-limit and pot-limit games, the house has the right to place a maximum time\n\nlimit for taking action on your hand.

Players are asked to refrain from instigating proposition wagers in any form. The players are allowed to agree to deal twice (or three times) when someone is all -in. \u201cDealing twice\u201d means the pot is divided in two, with each portion being dealt for separately. POT-LIMIT RULES 1. If a wager is made that exceeds the pot size, the surplus will be given back to the bettor as soon as possible, and the amount will be reduced to th e maximum allowable. 2. The dealer or any player in the game can and should call attention to a wager that appears to exceed the pot size (this also applies to heads -up pots). The oversize\n\nwager may be corrected at any point until all players have acted on it.\n\n3. If an oversize wager has stood for a length of time with someone considering what\n\naction to take, that person has had to act on a wager that was thought to be a\n\ncertain size. If the player then decides to call or raise, and attention is called at t his\n\nlate point to whether this is an allowable amount, the floorperson may rule that the\n\noversize amount must stand (especially if the person now trying to reduce the\n\namount is the person that made the wager).\n\n4. The maximum amount a player can raise is t he amount in the pot after the call is\n\nmade. Therefore, if a pot is $100, and someone makes a $50 bet, the next player\n\ncan call $50 and raise the pot $200, for a total wager of $250.\n\n5. In pot-limit play, it is advisable in many structures to round off th e pot size upward\n\nto produce a faster pace of play. This is done by treating any odd amount as the\n\nNO-LIMIT AND POT-LIMIT\n\n42\n\nnext larger size. For example, if the pot size was being kept track of with $25 units,\n\nthen a pot size of $80 would be treated as a pot size of $100.\n\n6.

If an oversize wager has stood for a length of time with someone considering what action to take, that person has had to act on a wager that was thought to be a certain size. If the player then decides to call or raise, and attention is called at t his late point to whether this is an allowable amount, the floorperson may rule that the oversize amount must stand (especially if the person now trying to reduce the amount is the person that made the wager). 4. The maximum amount a player can raise is t he amount in the pot after the call is made. Therefore, if a pot is $100, and someone makes a $50 bet, the next player can call $50 and raise the pot $200, for a total wager of $250. 5. In pot-limit play, it is advisable in many structures to round off th e pot size upward to produce a faster pace of play. This is done by treating any odd amount as the NO-LIMIT AND POT-LIMIT 42 next larger size. For example, if the pot size was being kept track of with $25 units, then a pot size of $80 would be treated as a pot size of $100. 6.
