{"chunks": ["ROBERT\u2019S RULES OF POKER \nVERSION 11 \n\u201cRobert\u2019s Rules Of Poker\u201d is authored by Robert Ciaffone, better known in the poker world as \nBob Ciaffone, a leading authority on cardroom rules. He is the person who has selected which \nrules to use, and formatted, organized, and worded the text. Nearly all these rules are substantively \nin common use for poker, but many improved ideas for wording and organization are employed \nthroughout this work. A lot of the rules are similar to those used in the rulebook of cardrooms \nwhere he has acted as a rules consultant and rules drafter. Ciaffone authored the rulebook for the \nPoker Players Association (founded in 1984, now defunct), the first comprehensive set of poker \nrules for the general public. He has done extensive work on rules for the Las Vegas Hilton, The \nMirage, and Hollywood Park Casino, and assisted many other cardrooms. Ciaffone is a regular \ncolumnist for Card Player magazine, and can be reached through that publication. This rulebook \nwill be periodically revised, so suggestions are welcome. \nPoker rules are widely used and freely copied, so it is impossible to construct a rulebook \nwithout using many rules that exist as part of a rule set of some cardroom. If such a rule is used, \nno credit is given to the source (which is unlikely to be the original one for the rule). \nThe goal of this rulebook is to produce the best set of rules in existence, and make it generally \navailable, so any person or cardroom can use it who so desires. The purpose is the betterment of \npoker. \nThe general philosophy used in this rulebook is to make the rules sufficiently detailed so a \ndecision-maker will know what the proper ruling is in each situation. A rule should do more than \nproduce the right ruling. It should be stated so the decision-maker can refer to specific language in \nthe rulebook, to have the ruling is accepted as correct. \nThe author has strongly supported uniform poker rules, and applauds the work done in this \ndirection by the Tournament Director\u2019s Association (TDA). Nearly all the rules herein are \ncompatible with the TDA rules, although there are some slight differences in wording. \nThis rulebook may be copied or downlo aded by anyone, provided it is not sold for profit \nwithout written permission from the author, and the name \u201cRobert\u2019s Rules of Poker\u201d is used or \ncredited. Excerpts of less than a full chapter may be used without restriction or credit. People are \nwelcome to use these rules, and even put their own business name on them, but this does not give \na person or business any rights other than to use the rules in their own establishment, or to make \ncopies available to someone else with the same restrictions applied to the recipient as stated here. \nAnyone may make copies of these rules and distribute them at no charge to recipients as a business \npromotion without obtaining permission. \nTHIS IS THE OFFICIAL RULEBOOK FOR OUR CARDROOM \nWelcome to our cardroom. Your presence in our establishment means that you agree to abide by \nour rules and procedures. By taking a seat in one of our card games, you are accepting our \nmanagement to be the final authority on all matters relating to that game. \n \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n(1) PROPER BEHAVIOR .........................1 \n Conduct Code 1 \n Poker Etiquette 1 \n Tobacco Use 2 \n(2) HOUSE POLICIES ...............................3 \n Decision-Making 3 \n Procedures 3 \n Seating 6 \n(3) GENERAL POKER RULES ................8 \nThe Buy-In 8 \nMisdeals 8 \nDead Hands 9 \nIrregularities 9 \nBetting and Raising 11 \nThe Showdown 13 \nTies 14 \n(4) BUTTON AND BLIND USE ...............16 \n(5) HOLDEM ............................................19 \n(6) OMAHA .................................................21 \n(7) OMAHA HIGH-LOW ..........................22 \n(8) SEVEN-CARD STUD ...........................23 \n(9) SEVEN-CARD STUD LOW (RAZZ) ..26 \n(10) SEVEN-CARD STUD HIGH-LOW ....27 \n(11) LOWBALL ............................................28 \n Ace-to-five Lowball 30 \n Deuce-to-seven Lowball 31 \n No-limit and Pot-limit Lowball 32 \n(12) DRAW HIGH .......................................33 \n The Joker 34 \n(13) KILL POTS ..........................................35 \n(14) NO-LIMIT AND POT-LIMIT ...........37 \n Pot-limit 40 \n(15) TOURNAMENTS ...............................41 \n(16) EXPLANATIONS ...............................45 \n GLOSSARY ........................................48 \n \n1 \nSECTION 1 - PROPER BEHAVIOR \nCONDUCT CODE \nManagement will attempt to maintain a pleasant environment for all our customers and employees, \nbut is not responsible for the conduct of any player. We have established a code of conduct, and \nmay deny the use of our cardroom to violators. The following are not permitted: \nCollusion with another player or any other form of cheating. \nVerbally or physically threatening any patron or employee. \nUsing profanity or obscene language. \nCreating a disturbance by arguing, shouting, or making excessive noise. \nThrowing, tearing, bending, or crumpling cards. \nDestroying or defacing property. \nUsing an illegal substance. \nCarrying a weapon. \nPOKER ETIQUETTE \nThe following actions are improper, and grounds for warning, suspending, or barring a violator: \nDeliberately acting out of turn. \nDeliberately splashing chips into the pot. \nAgreeing to check a hand out when a third player is all-in. \nSoftplaying by refusing to bet against a certain opponent whenever heads-up. \nReading a hand for another player at the showdown before it has been placed faceup on the table. \nTelling anyone to turn a hand faceup at the showdown. \nRevealing the contents of a live hand in a multihanded pot before the betting is complete. \nRevealing the contents of a folded hand before the betting is complete. Do not divulge the contents \nof a hand during a deal even to someone not in the pot, so you do not leave any possibility of the \ninformation being transmitted to an active player. \nNeedlessly stalling the action of a game. \nDeliberately discarding hands away from the muck. Cards should be released in a low line of flight, \nat a moderate rate of speed (not at the dealer's hands or chip-rack). \n1-PROPER BEHAVIOR \n2 \nStacking chips in a manner that interferes with dealing or viewing cards. \nMaking statements or taking action that could unfairly influence the course of play, whether or not \nthe offender is involved in the pot. \nUsing a cell phone at the table. \nTOBACCO USE \n(These rules are for an establishment that does not completely bar smoking.) \nThe seat on each side of the dealer is a nonsmoking seat. \nCigar or pipe smoking is not allowed in the cardroom. \nSmoking by a guest or spectator is not allowed. \n \n3 \nSECTION 2 - HOUSE POLICIES \nDECISION-MAKING \n1. Management reserves the right to make d ecisions in the spirit of fairness, even if a strict \ninterpretation of the rules may indicate a different ruling. \n2. Decisions of the shift supervisor are final. \n3. The proper time to draw attention to a mistake is when it occurs or is first noticed. Any delay \nmay affect the ruling. \n4. If an incorrect rule interpretation or decision by an employee is made in good faith, the \nestablishment has no liability. \n5. A ruling may be made regarding a pot if it has been requested before the next deal starts (or \nbefore the game either ends or changes to another table). Otherwise, the result of a deal must \nstand. The first riffle of the shuffle marks the start for a deal. \n6. If a pot has been incorrectly awarded and mingled with chips that were not in the pot, and the \ntime limit for a ruling request given in the previous rule has been observed, management may \ndetermine how much was in the pot by reconstructing the betting, an d then transfer that \namount to the proper player. \n7. To keep the action moving, it is possible that a game may be asked to continue even though a \ndecision is delayed. The delay could be to check the overhead camera tape, get the shift \nsupervisor to give the ruling, or for some other good reason. In such circumstances, a pot or \nportion of it may be impounded by the house while the decision is pending. \n8. The same action may have a different meaning, depending on who does it, so the possible \nintent of an offe nder will be taken into consideration. Some factors here are the person\u2019s \namount of poker experience and past record. \n9. A player, before he acts, is entitled to request and receive information as to whether any \nopposing hand is alive or dead, or whether a wager is of sufficient size to reopen the betting. \nPROCEDURES \n1. Only one person may play a hand. \n2. No one is allowed to play another player\u2019s chips. \n3. Management will decide when to start or close any game. \n2-HOUSE POLICIES \n4 \n4. Collections (seat rental fees) are paid in advance. In all time -collection games, the dealer is \nrequired to pick up the collection from each player before dealing. A player not wishing to \npay collection may play one courtesy hand in stud, and may play until the blind in button \ngames, provided no one is waiting for the game. If there is more than one person on the list \nfor that game when the collection becomes due, everyone must pay collection. A new player \nis not required to pay if there is either no list or only one person waiting. \n5. Cash is not allowed on the table. All cash should be changed into chips in order to play. If a \nplayer seems unaware of this rule and tries to play unnoticed cash that was on the table during \na pot, the dealer may let the cash play if no o ne in the pot objects, then have all the cash \nchanged into chips after the hand. Any chips from another cardroom are not permitted on the \ntable, do not play in the game, and when found will be treated similarly to unnoticed cash. \n[See Section 16 \u2013 \u201cExplanations,\u201d discussion #5, for more information on this rule.] \n6. Money and chips may be removed for security purposes when leaving the table. The \nestablishment is not responsible for any shortage or removal of chips left on the table during \na player\u2019s absence, even though we will try to protect everyone as best we can. All removed \nfunds must be fully restored when returning to the game. \n7. If you return to the same game within one hour of cashing out, your buy -in must be equal to \nthe amount removed when leaving that game. \n8. All games are table stakes (except \u201cplaying behind\u201d as given in the next rule). Only the chips \nin front of a player at the start of a deal may play for that hand, except for chips not yet received \nthat a player has purchased. The amount bou ght must be announced to the table, or only the \namount of the minimum buy -in plays. Awareness of the amount being in play for each \nopponent is an important part of poker. All chips and money must be kept in plain view. \n9. \"Playing behind\" is allowed only f or the amount of purchased chips while awaiting their \narrival. The amount in play must be announced to the table, or only the amount of the \nminimum buy-in plays. \n10. Playing out of a rack is not allowed. \n11. Permission is required before taking a seat in a game. \n12. Playing over without permission from the floorperson is not allowed. A playover box is \nrequired. Permission from the absent player is not necessary. \n13. Pushing bets (\u201csaving\u201d or \u201cpotting out\u201d) is not allowed. \n14. Pushing an ante or posting for another person is not allowed. \n2-HOUSE POLICIES \n5 \n15. Splitting pots will not be allowed in any game. Chopping the big and small blind by taking \nthem back when all other players have folded is allowed in button games. \n16. Insurance propositions are not allowed. Dealing twice (or three times) when all-in is permitted \nat big-bet poker. \n17. The game's betting limit will not be changed if two or more players object. Raising the limit \nis subject to management approval. \n18. Players must keep their cards in full view. This means above table-level and not past the edge \nof the table. The cards should not be covered by the hands in a manner to completely conceal \nthem. \n19. Any player is entitled to a clear view of an opponent\u2019s chips. Highe r denomination chips \nshould be easily visible. \n20. Your chips may be picked up if you are away from the table for more than 30 minutes. Your \nabsence may be extended if you notify a floorperson in advance. Frequent or continuous \nabsences may cause your chips to be picked up from the table. \n21. A lock-up in a new game will be picked up after five minutes if someone is waiting to play. \nNo seat may be locked up for more than ten minutes if someone is waiting to play. \n22. A new deck must be used for at least a f ull round (once around the table) before it may be \nchanged, and a new setup must be used for at least an hour, unless a deck is defective or \ndamaged, or cards become sticky. \n23. Looking through the discards or deck stub is not allowed. \n24. After a deal ends, dealers are asked to not show what card would have been dealt. \n25. A player is expected to pay attention to the game and not hold up play. Activity that interferes \nwith this such as reading at the table is discouraged, and the player will be asked to cease if a \nproblem is caused. \n26. A non-player may not sit at the table. \n27. In non-tournament games, you may have a guest sit behind you if no one in the game objects. \nIt is improper for a guest to look at any hand other then your own. \n28. Speaking a foreign language during a deal is not allowed. \n2-HOUSE POLICIES \n6 \nSEATING \n1. You must be present to add your name to a waiting list. \n2. It is the player\u2019s responsibility to be in the playing area and hear the list being called. A player \nwho intends to leave the playing area should notify the list -person, and can leave money for \na lockup. The lockup amount is $20. \n3. When there is more than one game of the same stakes and poker form, a nd a must-move is \nnot being used, the house will control the seating of new players to best preserve the viability \nof existing games. A new player will be sent to the game most in need of an additional player. \nA transfer to a similar game is not allowed if the game being left will then have fewer players \nthan the game being entered. \n4. A player may not hold a seat in more than one game. \n5. The house reserves the right to require that any two players not play in the same game \n(husband and wife, relatives, business partners, and so forth). \n6. When a button game starts, active players will draw a card for the button position. The button \nwill be awarded to the highest card by suit for all high and high-low games, and to the lowest \ncard by suit for all low games. \n7. To avoid a seating dispute, a supervisor may decide to start the game with one extra player \nover the normal number. If so, a seat will be removed as soon as someone quits the game. \n8. In a new game, the player who arrives at the table the earliest gets first choice of remaining \nseats. If two players want the same seat and arrive at the same time, the higher player on the \nlist has preference. A player playing a pot in another game may have a designated seat locked \nup until that hand is finished. Management may reserve a certain seat for a player for a good \nreason, such as to assist reading the board for a person with a vision problem. \n9. To protect an existing game, a forced move may be invoked when an additional game of the \nsame type and limit is started . The must -move list is maintained in the same order as the \noriginal waiting list. If a player refuses to move into the main game, that player will be forced \nto quit, and cannot play in the must-move game or get on that list for one hour. \n10. In all button games, a player going from a must-move game to the main game may play until \ndue for the big blind. The player must then enter the game as a new player, and may either \npost an amount equal to the big blind or wait for the big blind. In all stud games, a player may \nplay only one more hand before moving. \n2-HOUSE POLICIES \n7 \n11. You must play in a new game or must-move game to retain your place on the list, if with your \nplaying there would be three or fewer empty seats. \n12. A player who is already in the game has precedence over a new player for any seat when it \nbecomes available. However, no change will occur after a new player has been seated, or after \nthat player\u2019s buy -in or marker has been placed on the table, unless that particular seat had \nbeen previously requested. For players already in the game, the one who asks the earliest has \npreference for a seat change. \n13. In all button games, a player voluntarily locking up a seat in another game must move \nimmediately if there is a waiting list of two or more names for the seat being vacated, except \nthat the player is entitled to play the button if a blind has already been taken. Otherwise, a \nplayer may play up to the blind before moving. In a stud game, a player changing tables may \nplay only the present hand if someone is waiting for the seat being vacated, or one more hand \nwhen no one is waiting. \n14. When a game breaks, each player may draw a card to determine the seating order for a similar \ngame. The floorperson draws a card for an absent player. If the card entitles the absent player \nto an immediate seat, the player has until due for the big blind in a button game to take the \nseat (two hands in a stud game), and will be put first up on the list if not back in time. \n \n8 \nSECTION 3 - GENERAL POKER RULES \nTHE BUY-IN \n1. When you enter a game, you must make a full buy-in. At limit poker, a full buy-in is at least \nten times the maximum bet for the game being played, unless designated otherwise. \n2. You are allowed to make only one short buy -in for a game. Adding to your stack is not \nconsidered a buy-in, and may be done in any quantity between hands. \n3. A player coming from a broken game or must -move game to a game of the same limit may \ncontinue to play the same amount of mo ney, even if it is less than the minimum buy -in. A \nplayer switching games voluntarily must have the proper buy -in size for the new game. A \nplayer switching games is not required to buy in for any more than the minimum amount. \nMISDEALS \n1. Once action begins, a misdeal cannot be called. The deal will be played, and no money will \nbe returned to any player whose hand is fouled. In button games, action is considered to occur \nwhen two players after the blinds have acted on their hands. In stud games, action is \nconsidered to occur when two players after the forced bet have acted on their hands. \n2. The following circumstances cause a misdeal, provided attention is called to the error before \ntwo players have acted on their hands. \n(a) The first or second card of the hand has been exposed by a dealer error. \n(b) Two or more cards have been exposed by the dealer. \n(c) Two or more boxed cards (improperly faced cards) are found. \n(d) Two or more extra cards have been dealt in the starting hands of a game. \n(e) An incorrect number of cards has been dealt to a player, except the top card may be dealt if it \ngoes to the player in proper sequence. \n(f) Any card has been dealt out of the proper sequence (except an exposed card may be replaced \nby the burncard). \n(g) The button was out of position. \n(h) The first card was dealt to the wrong position. \n(i) Cards have been dealt to an empty seat or a player not entitled to a hand. \n(j) A player has been dealt out who is entitled to a hand. This player must be present at the table \nor have posted a blind or ante. \n3-GENERAL POKER RULES \n9 \nDEAD HANDS \n1. Your hand is declared dead if: \n(a) You fold or announce that you are folding when facing a bet or a raise. \n(b) You throw your hand away in a forward motion causing another player to act behind you \n(even if not facing a bet). \n (c) In stud, when facing a bet, you pick your upcards off the table, turn your upcards \nfacedown, or mix your upcards and downcards together. \n (d) The hand does not contain the proper number of cards for that particular game (except at \nstud a hand missing the final card may be ruled live, and at lowball and draw high a hand \nwith too few cards before the draw is live). [See Section 16 - \u201cExplanations,\u201d discussion \n#4, for more information on the stud portion of this rule.] \n(e) You act on a hand with a joker as a holecard in a game not using a joker. (A player who \nacts on a hand without looking at a card assumes the liability of finding an improper card, \nas given in Irregularities, rule #8.) \n(f) You have the clock on you when facing a bet or raise and exceed the specified time limit. \n2. Cards thrown into the muck may be ruled dead. However, a hand that is clearly identifiable \nmay be retrieved and ruled live at management\u2019s discretion if doing so is in the best interest \nof the game. An extra effort should be made to rule a hand retrievable if it was folded as a \nresult of incorrect information given to the player. \n3. Cards thrown into another player\u2019s hand are dead, whether they are faceup or facedown. \nIRREGULARITIES \n1. In button games, if it is discovered that the button was placed incorrectly on the previous hand, \nthe button and blinds will be corrected for the new hand in a manner that gives every player \none chance for each position on the round (if possible). \n2. You must protect your own hand at all times. Your cards may be protected with your hands, \na chip, or other object placed on top of them. If you fail to protect your hand, you will have \nno redress if it becomes fouled or the dealer accidentally kills it. \n3. If a card with a different color back appears during a hand, all action is void and all chips in \nthe pot are returned to the respective bettors. If a card with a different color back is discovered \nin the stub, all action stands. \n3-GENERAL POKER RULES \n10 \n4. If two cards of the same rank and suit are found, all action is void, and all chips in the pot are \nreturned to the players who wagered them (subject to next rule). \n5. A player who knows the deck is defective has an obligation to point this out. If such a player \ninstead tries to win a pot by taking aggressive action (trying for a freeroll), the player may \nlose the right to a refund, and the chips may be required to stay in the pot for the next deal. \n6. If there is extra money in the pot on a deal as a res ult of forfeited money from the previous \ndeal (as per rule #5), or some similar reason, only a player dealt in on the previous deal is \nentitled to a hand. \n7. A card discovered faceup in the deck (boxed card) will be treated as a meaningless scrap of \npaper. A card being treated as a scrap of paper will be replaced by the next card below it in \nthe deck, except when the next card has already been dealt facedown to another player and \nmixed in with other downcards. In that case, the card that was faceup in the d eck will be \nreplaced after all other cards are dealt for that round. \n8. A joker that appears in a game where it is not used is treated as a scrap of paper. Discovery of \na joker does not cause a misdeal. If the joker is discovered before a player acts on hi s or her \nhand, it is replaced as in the previous rule. If the player does not call attention to the joker \nbefore acting, then the player has a dead hand. \n9. If you play a hand without looking at all of your cards, you assume the liability of having an \nirregular card or an improper joker. \n10. One or more cards missing from the deck does not invalidate the results of a hand. \n11. Before the first round of betting, if a dealer deals one additional card, it is returned to the deck \nand used as the burncard. \n12. Procedure for an exposed card varies with the poker form, and is given in the section for each \ngame. A card that is flashed by a dea ler is treated as an exposed card. A card that is flashed \nby a player will play. To obtain a ruling on whether a card was exposed and should be \nreplaced, a player should announce that the card was flashed or exposed before looking at it. \nA downcard dealt off the table is an exposed card. \n13. If a card is exposed due to dealer error, a player does not have an option to take or reject the \ncard. The situation will be governed by the rules for the particular game being played. \n14. If you drop any cards out of your hand onto the floor, you must still play them. \n15. If the dealer prematurely deals any cards before the betting is complete, those cards will not \nplay, even if a player who has not acted decides to fold. \n3-GENERAL POKER RULES \n11 \n16. If the dealer fails to burn a card or burns more than one card, the error should be corrected if \ndiscovered before betting action has started for that round. Once action has been taken on a \nboardcard, the card must stand. Whether the error is able to be corrected or not, subsequent \ncards dealt should be those that would have come if no error had occurred. For example, if \ntwo cards were burned, one of the cards should be put back on the deck and used for the \nburncard on the next round. On the last round, if there was no betting because a player was \nall-in, the error should be corrected if discovered before the pot has been awarded, provided \nthe deck stub, boardcards, and burncards are all sufficiently intact to determine the proper \nreplacement card. \n17. If the deck stub gets fouled for some reason, suc h as the dealer believing the deal is over and \ndropping the deck, the deal must still be played out, and the deck reconstituted in as fair a way \nas possible. \nBETTING AND RAISING \n1. The smallest chip that may be wagered in a game is the smallest chip used in the antes, blinds, \nrake, or collection. (Certain games may use a special rule that does not allow chips used only \nin house revenue to play.) Smaller chips than this do not play even in quantity, so a player \nwanting action on such chips must change them up between deals. If betting is in dollar units \nor greater, a fraction of a dollar does not play. A player going all -in must put all chips that \nplay into the pot. \n2. Check-raise is permitted in all games, except in certain forms of lowball. \n3. In no-limit and pot-limit games, unlimited raising is allowed. \n4. In limit poker, for a pot involving three or more players who are not all -in, these limits on \nraises apply: \n (a) A game with three or more betting rounds allows a maximum of a bet and three raises. \n(b) A game with two betting rounds (such as lowball or draw) allows a maximum of a bet and \nfour raises. [See \u201cSection 16 - Explanations,\u201d discussion #6, for more information on this \nrule.] \n5. Unlimited raising is allowed in heads -up play except in tournaments. This applies any time \nthe action becomes heads-up before the raising has been capped. Once the raising is capped \non a betting round, it cannot be uncapped by a subsequent fold that leaves two players heads-\nup. (For tournament play in limit events there wil l be a limit to raises even when heads -up \nuntil the tournament is down to two players.) \n3-GENERAL POKER RULES \n12 \n6. Any wager not all-in must be at least the size of the previous bet or raise in that round. \n7. In limit play, an all-in wager of less than half a bet does not reopen the betting for any player \nwho has already acted and is in the pot for all previous bets. A player who has not yet acted \n(or had the betting reopened to him by another player\u2019s action), facing an all-in wager of less \nthan half a bet, may fold, call, or complete the wager. An all-in wager of a half a bet or more \nis treated as a full bet, and a player may fold, call, or make a full raise. (An example of a full \nraise on a $20 betting round is raising a $15 all-in bet to $35.) Multiple all-in wagers, each of \nan amount too small to individually qualify as a raise, still act as a raise and reopen the betting \nif the resulting wager size to a player qualifies as a raise. \n8. In limit poker, if you make a forward motion with chips and thus cause another player to act, \nyou may be forced to complete your action. \n9. A verbal statement in turn denotes your action, is binding, and takes precedence over a \ndiffering physical action. \n10. Rapping the table with your hand is a pass. \n11. Deliberately acting out of turn will not be tolerated. A player who checks out of turn may not \nbet or raise on the next turn to act. A player who has called out of turn may not change his \nwager to a raise on the next turn to act. An action or verbal declaration out of turn is binding \nunless the action to that player is subsequently changed by a bet or raise. If there is an \nintervening call, an action may be ruled binding. \n3-GENERAL POKER RULES \n13 \n12. To retain the right to act, a player must stop the ac tion by calling \u201ctime\u201d (or an equivalent \nword). Failure to stop the action before three or more players have acted behind you may \ncause you to lose the right to act. You cannot forfeit your right to act if any player in front of \nyou has not acted, only if you fail to act when it legally becomes your turn. Therefore, if you \nwait for someone whose turn comes before you, and three or more players act behind you, \nthis still does not hinder your right to act. \n13. A player who bets or calls by releasing chips int o the pot is bound by that action and must \nmake the amount of the wager correct. (This also applies right before the showdown when \nputting chips into the pot causes the opponent to show the winning hand before the full amount \nneeded to call has been put in to the pot.) However, if you are unaware that the pot has been \nraised, you may withdraw that money and reconsider your action, provided that no one else \nhas acted after you. At pot -limit or no -limit betting, if there is a gross misunderstanding \nconcerning the amount of the wager, see Section 14, Rule 8. \n14. String raises are not allowed. The dealer should enforce obvious infractions to this string-raise \nlaw without being asked. To protect your right to raise, you should either declare your \nintention verbally or place the proper amount of chips into the pot. Putting a full bet plus a \nhalf-bet or more into the pot is considered to be the same as announcing a raise, and the raise \nmust be completed. (This does not apply in the use of a single chip of greater value.) \n15. If you put a single chip in the pot that is larger than the bet, but do not announce a raise, you \nare assumed to have only called. Example: In a $3 -$6 game, when a player bets $6 and the \nnext player puts a $25 chip in the pot without saying anyth ing, that player has merely called \nthe $6 bet. \n16. All wagers and calls of an improperly low amount must be brought up to proper size if the \nerror is discovered before the betting round has been completed. This includes actions such \nas betting a lower amount than the minimum bring-in (other than going all-in) and betting the \nlower limit on an upper limit betting round. If a wager is supposed to be made in a rounded \noff amount, is not, and must be corrected, it shall be changed to the proper amount nearest in \nsize. No one who has acted may change a call to a raise because the wager size has been \nchanged. \nTHE SHOWDOWN \n1. To win any part of a pot, a player must show all of his cards faceup on the table, whether they \nwere used in the final hand played or not. \n3-GENERAL POKER RULES \n14 \n2. Cards speak (cards read for themselves). The dealer assists in reading hands, but players are \nresponsible for holding onto their cards until the winner is declared. Although verbal \ndeclarations as to the contents of a hand are not binding, deliberately mi scalling a hand with \nthe intent of causing another player to discard a winning hand is unethical and may result in \nforfeiture of the pot. (For more information on miscalling a hand see \u201cSection 11 - Lowball,\u201d \nRule 15 and Rule 16.) \n3. Any player, dealer, or floorperson who sees an incorrect amount of chips put into the pot, or \nan error about to be made in awarding a pot, has an ethical obligation to point out the error. \nPlease help keep mistakes of this nature to a minimum. \n4. All losing hands will be killed by the dealer before a pot is awarded. \n5. Any player who has been dealt in may request to see any hand that was eligible to participate \nin the showdown, even if the opponent's hand or the winning hand has been mucked. \nHowever, this is a privilege that may be revoked if abused. If a player other than the pot \nwinner asks to see a hand that has been folded, that hand is dead. If the winning player asks \nto see a losing player\u2019s hand, both hands are live, and the best hand wins. \n6. Show one, show all. Players a re entitled to receive equal access to information about the \ncontents of another player\u2019s hand. After a deal, if cards are shown to another player, every \nplayer at the table has a right to see those cards. During a deal, cards that were shown to an \nactive player who might have a further wagering decision on that betting round must \nimmediately be shown to all the other players. If the player who saw the cards is not involved \nin the deal, or cannot use the information in wagering, the information should be wi thheld \nuntil the betting is over, so it does not affect the normal outcome of the deal. Cards shown to \na person who has no more wagering decisions on that betting round, but might use the \ninformation on a later betting round, should be shown to the other p layers at the conclusion \nof that betting round. If only a portion of the hand has been shown, there is no requirement to \nshow any of the unseen cards. The shown cards are treated as given in the preceding part of \nthis rule. \n7. If there is a side pot, the winner of that pot should be decided before the main pot is awarded. \nIf there are multiple side pots, they are decided and awarded by having the pot with the players \nstarting the deal with the greatest number of chips settled first, and so forth. \n3-GENERAL POKER RULES \n15 \n8. If everyone checks (or is all -in) on the final betting round, the player who acted first is the \nfirst to show the hand. If there is wagering on the final betting round, the last player to take \naggressive action by a bet or raise is the first to show the hand. In order to speed up the game, \na player holding a probable winner is encouraged to show the hand without delay. If there are \none or more side pots (because someone is all-in), players are asked to aid in determining the \npot winner by not showing their cards until a pot they are in is being settled. A player may opt \nto throw his hand away after all the betting for the deal is over, rather than compete to win the \npot. However, the other players do not lose the right to request the hand be shown if he does \nso. \nTIES \n1. The ranking of suits from highest to lowest is spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs. Suits never \nbreak a tie for winning a pot. Suits are used to break a tie between cards of the same rank (no \nredeal or redraw). \n2. Dealing a card to each player is used to determine things like who moves to another table. If \nthe cards are dealt, the order is clockwise starting with the first player on the dealer\u2019s left (the \nbutton position is irrelevant). Drawing a card is used to determine t hings like who gets the \nbutton in a new game, or seating order coming from a broken game. \n3. An odd chip will be broken down to the smallest unit used in the game. \n4. No player may receive more than one odd chip. \n5. If two or more hands tie, an odd chip will be awarded as follows: \n(a) In a button game, the first hand clockwise from the button gets the odd chip. \n(b) In a stud game, the odd chip will be given to the highest card by suit in all high games, and \nto the lowest card by suit in all low games. (When making this determination, all cards are \nused, not just the five cards that constitute the player's hand.) \n(c) In high-low split games, the high hand receives the odd chip in a split between the high and \nthe low hands. The odd chip between tied high hands is awarded as in a high game of that \npoker form, and the odd chip between tied low hands is awarded as in a low game of that \npoker form. If two players have identical hands, the pot will be split as evenly as possible. \n(d) All side pots and the main pot will be split as separate pots, not mixed together. \n \n16 \nSECTION 4 - BUTTON AND BLIND USE \nIn button games, a non -playing dealer normally does the actual dealing. A round disk called the \nbutton is used to indicate which player has the dealer position. The player with the button is last to \nreceive cards on the initial deal and has the right of last action on all but the first betting round. \nThe button moves one seat clockwise after a deal ends to rotate the advantage of last action. One \nor more blind bets are usually used to stimulate action and initiate play. Blinds are posted before \nthe players look at their cards. Blinds are part of a player\u2019s bet (unless a certain structure or \nsituation specifies otherwise). A blind other than the big blind may be treated as dead (not part of \nthe poster\u2019s bet) in some structures, as when a special additional \"dead blind\" for the collection is \nspecified by a cardroom. With two blinds, the small blind is posted by the first player clockwise \nfrom the button and the big blind is posted by the second player clockwise from the button. With \nmore than two blinds, the smallest blind is normally left of the button (not on it). On the initial \nbetting round, action starts with the first player to the left of the blinds. On all subsequen t betting \nrounds, the action starts with the first active player to the left of the button. \nRULES FOR USING BLINDS \n1. The minimum bring -in and allowable raise sizes for the opener are specified by the poker \nform used and blind amounts set for a game. They remain the same even when the player in \nthe blind does not have enough chips to post the full amount. \n2. Each round every player must get an opportunity for the button, and meet the total amount of \nthe blind obligations. Either of the following methods of button and blind placement may be \ndesignated to do this: \n(a) Moving button \u2013 The button always moves forward to the next player and the blinds \nadjust accordingly. There may be more than one big blind. \n(b) Dead button \u2013 The big blind is posted by the player due for it, and the small blind and \nbutton are positioned accordingly, even if this means the small blind or the button is \nplaced in front of an empty seat, giving the same player the privilege of last action on \nconsecutive hands. [See \u201cSection 16 \u2013 Explanations,\u201d discussion #1, for more \ninformation on this rule.] \n3. In heads-up play with two blinds, the small blind is on the button. When play becomes heads-\nup, the player who had the big blind the most recently is given the button, and his opponent is \ngiven the big blind. \n4. A new player entering the game has the following options: \n(a) Wait for the big blind. \n(b) Post an amount equal to the big blind and immediately be dealt a hand. (In lowball, a \nnew player must either post an amount double the big blind or wait for the big blind.) \n4-BUTTON AND BLIND USE \n17 \n5. A new player who elects to let the button go by once without posting is not treated as a player \nin the game who has missed a blind, and needs to post only the big blind when entering the \ngame. \n6. A person playing over is considered to be a new player, and must post the amount of the big \nblind or wait for the big blind. \n7. A new player cannot be dealt in between the big blind and the button. Blinds may not be made \nup between the big blind and the button. You must wait until the button passes. [See \u201cSection \n16 \u2013 Explanations,\u201d discussion #5, for more information on this rule.] \n8. Chips posted by the big blind are treated as a bet. \n9. A player posting a blind in the game\u2019s regular structure has the option of raising the pot at the \nfirst turn to act. This option to raise is retained if someone goes all -in with a wager of less \nthan the minimum raise. \n10. A player who misses any or all blinds can resume play by either posting all the blinds missed \nor waiting for the big blind. If you choose to post the total amount of the blinds, an amount \nup to the size of the minimum opening bet is live. The remainder is taken by the dealer to the \ncenter of the pot and is not part of your bet. When it is your next turn to act, y ou have the \noption to raise. \n11. If a player who owes a blind (as a result of a missed blind) is dealt in without posting, the \nhand is dead if the player looks at it before putting up the required chips, and has not yet acted. \nIf the player acts on the hand and plays it, putting chips into the pot before the error is \ndiscovered, the hand is live, and the player is required to post on the next deal. \n12. A player who goes all-in and loses is obligated to make up the blinds if they are missed before \na rebuy is made. (The person is not treated as a new player when reentering.) \n13. These rules about blinds apply to a newly started game: \n(a) Any player who drew for the button is considered active in the game and is required to \nmake up any missed blinds. \n(b) A new player will not be required to post a blind until the button has made one complete \nrevolution around the table, provided a blind has not yet passed that seat. \n(c) A player may change seats without penalty, provided a blind has not yet passed the new \nseat. \n14. If you move closer to the big blind, you can be dealt in without any penalty. \n4-BUTTON AND BLIND USE \n18 \n15. In all multiple-blind games, a player who changes seats will be dealt in on the first available \nhand in the same relative position. Example: If you move two active positions away from the \nbig blind, you must wait two hands before being dealt in again. If you do not wish to wait and \nhave not yet missed a blind, then you can post an amount equal to the big blind and receive a \nhand. (Exception: At lowball you must kill the pot, wait for the same relative position, or wait \nfor the big blind; see \u201cSection 11 \u2013 Lowball,\u201d rule #7.) \n16. A player who \"deals off\" (by playing the button and then immediately getting up to change \nseats) can allow the blinds to pass the new seat one time and reenter the game behind the \nbutton without having to post a blind. \n17. A live \u201cstraddle bet\" is not allowed at limit poker except in specified games. \n \n19 \nSECTION 5 - HOLDEM \nIn holdem, players receive two downcards as their personal hand (holecards), after which there is \na round of betting. Three boardcards are turned simultaneously (called the \u201cflop\u201d) and another \nround of betting occurs. The next two boardcards are turned one at a time, with a round of betting \nafter each card. The boardcards are common cards used by all players, and a player may use any \nfive-card combination from among the board and personal cards. A player may even use all of \nthe boardcards and no personal cards to form a hand (play the board). A dealer button is used. \nThe usual structure is to use two blinds, but it is possible to play the game with one blind, multiple \nblinds, an ante, or combination of blinds plus an ante. \nRULES \nThese rules deal only with irregularities. See the previous chapter, \u201cButton and Blind Use,\u201d for \nrules on that subject. \n1. If the initial holecard dealt to the first or second player is exposed, a misdeal results. The \ndealer will retrieve the card, reshuff le, and recut the cards. If any other holecard is exposed \ndue to a dealer error, the deal continues. The exposed card may not be kept. After completing \nthe hand, the dealer replaces the card with the top card on the deck, and the exposed card is \nthen used for the burncard. If more than one holecard is exposed, this is a misdeal and there \nmust be a redeal. \n2. If the dealer mistakenly deals the first player an extra card (after all players have received \ntheir starting hands), the card will be returned to the deck and used for the burncard. If the \ndealer mistakenly deals more than one extra card, it is a misdeal. \n3. If the flop contains too many cards, it must be redealt. (This applies even if it were possible \nto know which card was the extra one.) \n4. If the dealer failed to burn a card before dealing the flop, or burned two cards, the error should \nbe rectified by using the proper burncard and flop, if no boardcards were exposed. The deck \nmust be reshuffled if any boardcards were exposed. \n5. If the dealer burns and turns before a betting round is complete, the card(s) may not be used, \neven if all subsequent players elect to fold. Nobody has an option of accepting or rejecting the \ncard. The betting is then completed, and the error rectified in the prescribed manne r for that \nsituation. \n5-HOLD\u2019EM \n20 \n6. If the dealer fails to burn a card or burns more than one card, the error should be corrected if \ndiscovered before betting action has started for that round. Once action has been taken on a \nboardcard by any player, the card must stand. Whether the error is able to be corrected or not, \nsubsequent cards dealt should be those that would have come if no error had occurred. For \nexample, if two cards were burned, one of the cards should be put back on the deck and used \nfor the burncard on the next round. If there was no betting on a round because a player was \nall-in, the error should be corrected if discovered before the pot has been awarded. \n7. If the flop needs to be redealt for any reason, the boardcards are mixed with the remainder of \nthe deck. The burncard remains on the table. After shuffling, the dealer cuts the deck and deals \na new flop without burning a card. [See \u201cSection 16 \u2013 Explanations,\u201d discussion #4, for more \ninformation on this rule.] \n8. A dealing error for the fourth boardcard is rectified in a manner to least influence the identity \nof the boardcards that would have been used without the error. The dealer burns and deals \nwhat would have been the fifth card in the fourth card\u2019s place. After this round of betting, the \ndealer reshuffles the deck, including the card that was taken out of play, but not including the \nburncards or discards. The dealer then cuts the deck and deals the final card without burning \na card. If the fifth card is turned up prematurely, the deck is reshuff led and dealt in the same \nmanner. [See \u201cSection 16 \u2013 Explanations,\u201d discussion #4, for more information on this rule.] \n9. You must declare that you are playing the board before you throw your cards away. Otherwise, \nyou relinquish all claim to the pot. (The rule for tournament play is you must retain your hand \nand show it if asked, in order to win part of the pot.) \n \n21 \nSECTION 6 - OMAHA \nOmaha is similar to hold\u2019em in using a three-card flop on the board, a fourth boardcard, and then \na fifth boardcard. Each player is dealt four holecards (instead of two) at the start. In order to make \na valid hand, a player must use precisely two holecards with three boardcards. The betting is the \nsame as in holdem, using a preflop, flop, turn, and river betting rounds. At t he showdown, the \nentire four-card hand should be shown to receive the pot. \nRULES OF OMAHA \n1. All the rules of holdem apply to Omaha except the rule on playing the board, which is not \npossible in Omaha (because you must use two cards from your hand and three cards from the \nboard). \n \n22 \nSECTION 7 - OMAHA HIGH-LOW \nOmaha is often played high-low split. The player may use any combination of two holecards and \nthree boardcards for the high hand and another (or the same) combination of two holecards and \nthree boardcards for the low hand. \nThe rules governing kill pots are listed in \u201cSection 13 \u2013 Kill Pots.\u201d \nRULES OF OMAHA HIGH-LOW \n1. All the rules of Omaha apply to Omaha high-low split except as below. \n2. A qualifier of 8-or-better for low is used. This means to win the low half of the pot, a player\u2019s \nhand at the showdown must have five cards of different ranks that are an eight or lower in \nrank. (An ace is the highest card and also the lowest card.) If there is no qualifying hand for \nlow, the best high hand wins the whole pot. \n3. Straights and flushes do not impair the low value of a hand. \n \n23 \nSECTION 8 - SEVEN-CARD STUD \nSeven-card stud is played with a starting hand of two downcards and one upcard dealt before the \nfirst betting round. There are then three more upcards and a final downcard, with a betting round \nafter each, for a total of five betting rounds on a deal pl ayed to the showdown. The best five-card \npoker hand wins the pot. In all fixed-limit games, the smaller bet is wagered for the first two betting \nrounds, and the larger bet is wagered for the last three betting rounds (on the fifth, sixth, and \nseventh cards). If there is an open pair on the fourth card, any player has the option of making the \nsmaller or larger bet. Deliberately changing the order of your upcards in a stud game is improper \nbecause it unfairly misleads the other players. \nRULES OF SEVEN-CARD STUD \n1. If your first or second holecard is accidentally turned up by the dealer, then your third card \nwill be dealt down. If both holecards are dealt up, you have a dead hand and receive your ante \nback. If the first card dealt faceup would have been the low card, action starts with the first \nhand to that player\u2019s left. That player may fold, open for the forced bet, or open for a full bet. \n(In tournament play, if a downcard is dealt faceup, a misdeal is called.) \n2. The first round of betting starts with a forced bet by the lowest upcard by suit. On subsequent \nbetting rounds, the high hand on board initiates the action (a tie is broken by position, with \nthe player who received cards first acting first). \n3. The player with the forced bet has the option of opening for a full bet. \n4. If the player with the lowcard is all-in for the ante (or any player designated to start the action \non a round of betting is all -in), betting action proceeds to the first active player to the left of \nthe all-in player. If the player with the lowcard has only enough chips for a portion of the \nforced bet, the wager is made. All other players must enter for a t least the normal amount in \nthat structure. \n5. When the wrong person is designated as low and bets, if the next player has not yet acted, the \naction will be corrected to the real lowcard, who now must bet. The incorrect lowcard takes \nback the wager. If the next hand has acted after the incorrect lowcard wager, the wager stands, \naction continues from there, and the real lowcard has no obligations. \n6. Increasing the amount wagered by the opening forced bet up to a full bet does not count as a \nraise, but merely as a completion of the bet. For example: In $15-$30 stud, the lowcard opens \nfor $5. If the next player increases the bet to $15 (completes the bet), up to three raises are \nthen allowed when using a three-raise limit. \n8-SEVEN-CARD STUD \n24 \n7. In all fixed-limit games, when an open pair is showing on fourth street (second upcard), any \nplayer has the option of betting either the lower or the upper limit. For example: In a $5 -$10 \ngame, if you have a pair showing and are the high hand, you may bet either $5 or $10. If you \nbet $5, any player then has the option to call $5, raise $5, or raise $10. If a $10 raise is made, \nthen all other raises must be in increments of $10. If the player high with the open pair on \nfourth street checks, then subsequent players have the same options tha t were given to the \nplayer who was high. \n8. If you are not present at the table when it is your turn to act, you forfeit your ante and your \nforced bet, if any. If you have not returned to the table in time to act, the hand will be killed \nwhen the betting r eaches your seat. (In tournament play, the dealer is instructed to kill the \nhand of any absent player as soon as everyone has received their entire starting hand.) \n9. If a hand is folded when there is no wager, that seat will continue to receive cards unti l the \nhand is killed as a result of a bet (so the fold does not affect who gets the cards to come). \n10. When facing a wager, picking up your upcards without calling is a fold. This act has no \nsignificance at the showdown because betting is over; the hand is live until discarded. \n11. A card dealt off the table is treated as an exposed card. \n12. The dealer announces the lowcard, the high hand, all raises, and all pairs. Dealers do not \nannounce possible straights or flushes (except for specified low-stakes games). \n13. If the dealer burns two cards for one round or fails to burn a card, the cards will be corrected, \nif at all possible, to their proper positions. If this should happen on a final downcard, and \neither a card intermingles with a player's other holeca rds or a player looks at the card, the \nplayer must accept that card. \n14. If the dealer burns and deals one or more cards before a round of betting has been completed, \nthe card(s) must be eliminated from play. After the betting for that round is completed, an \nadditional card for each remaining player still active in the hand is also eliminated from play \n(to later deal the same cards to the players who would have received them without the error). \nAfter that round of betting has concluded, the dealer burns a c ard and play resumes. The \nremoved cards are held off to the side in the event the dealer runs out of cards. If the \nprematurely dealt card is the final downcard and has been looked at or intermingled with the \nplayer's other holecards, the player must keep the card, and on sixth street betting may not bet \nor raise (because the player now has all seven cards). \n8-SEVEN-CARD STUD \n25 \n15. If there are not enough cards left in the deck for all players, all the cards are dealt except the \nlast card, which is mixed with the burncards (and any cards removed from the deck, as in the \nprevious rule). The dealer then scrambles and cuts these cards, burns again, and delivers the \nremaining downcards, using the last card if necessary. If there are not as many cards as players \nremaining without a card, the dealer does not burn, so that each player can receive a fresh \ncard. If the dealer determines that there will not be enough fresh cards for all of the remaining \nplayers, then the dealer announces to the table that a common card will be used. The d ealer \nwill burn a card and turn one card faceup in the center of the table as a common card that \nplays in everyone\u2019s hand. The player who is now high using the common card initiates the \naction for the last round. \n16. An all-in player should receive holecar ds dealt facedown, but if the final holecard to such a \nplayer is dealt faceup, the card must be kept, and the other players receive their normal card. \n17. If the dealer turns the last card faceup to any player, the hand now high on the board using all \nthe upcards will start the action. The following rules apply to the dealing of cards: \n(a) If there are more than two players, all remaining players receive their last card facedown. \nA player whose last card is faceup has the option of declaring all-in before betting action \nstarts, meaning that the player does not put any more chips into the pot and subsequent \nbetting by the other active players will be on the side. \n(b) If there are only two players remaining and the first player's final downcard is dealt faceup, \nthe second player's final downcard will also be dealt faceup, and the betting proceeds as \nnormal. In the event the first player's final card is dealt facedown and the opponent's final \ncard is dealt faceup, the player with the faceup final card has the op tion of declaring all-\nin (before betting action starts). \n18. A hand with more than seven cards is dead. A hand with less than seven cards at the showdown \nis dead, except any player missing a seventh card may have the hand ruled live. [See \u201cSection \n16 \u2013 Explanations,\u201d discussion #2, for more information on this rule.] \n19. A player who calls a bet even though beaten by an opponent\u2019s upcards is not entitled to a \nrefund. (The caller receives information about the opponent that is not available for free.) \n \n26 \nSECTION 9 - SEVEN-CARD STUD LOW (RAZZ) \nThe lowest-ranking hand wins the pot. Aces are low only, and two aces are the lowest pair. The \nhigh card (aces are low) is required to make the forced bet on the first round; the low hand acts \nfirst on all subsequent rounds. Straights and flushes have no adverse effect on the low value of a \nhand, so the best possible hand is 5-4-3-2-A. An open pair does not affect the betting limit. \nRULES OF RAZZ \n1. All seven-card stud rules apply in razz except as otherwise noted. \n2. The highest card by suit starts the action with a forced bet. The low hand acts first on all \nsubsequent rounds. If the low hand is tied, the first player clockwise from the dealer starts \nthe action. \n3. Fixed-limit games use the lower limit on third and fou rth streets and the upper limit on \nsubsequent streets. An open pair does not affect the limit. \n4. The dealer announces all pairs the first time they occur, except pairs of facecards, which are \nnever announced. \n \n27 \nSECTION 10 - SEVEN-CARD STUD HIGH-LOW \nA qualifier of 8-or-better for low applies to all high -low split games. To win for low, a player\u2019s \nhand at the showdown must have five cards of different ranks that are an eight or lower. If there is \nno qualifier for low, the best high hand wins the whole p ot. Any five cards may be used to make \nthe best high hand, and the same or any other five cards to make the best low hand. \nRULES OF SEVEN-CARD STUD HIGH-LOW \n1. All rules for seven-card stud apply to seven-card stud high-low split, except as noted. \n2. A player may use any five cards to make the best high hand and any five cards, whether the \nsame as the high hand or not, to make the best low hand. \n3. An ace is the highest card and also the lowest card. \n4. The low card by suit initiates the action on the first round, with an ace counting as a high card \nfor this purpose. On subsequent rounds, the high hand initiates the action. If the high hand is \ntied, the first player in the tie clockwise from the dealer acts first. If the high hand is all -in, \naction proceeds clockwise as if that person had checked. \n5. Straights and flushes do not affect the value of a low hand. \n6. Fixed-limit games use the lower limit on third and fourth streets and the upper limit on \nsubsequent rounds. An open pair on fourth street does not affect the limit. \n7. Splitting pots is determined only by the cards, and not by agreement among players. \n8. When there is an odd chip in a pot, the chip goes to the high hand. If two players split the pot \nby tying for both the high and the low, the pot shall be split as evenly as possible, and the \nplayer with the highest card by suit receives the odd chip. When makin g this determination, \nall cards are used, not just the five cards used for the final hand played. \n9. When there is one odd chip in the high portion of the pot and two or more high hands split all \nor half the pot, the odd chip goes to the player with the hi gh card by suit. When two or more \nlow hands split half the pot, the odd chip goes to the player with the low card by suit. \n \n28 \nSECTION 11 - LOWBALL \nLowball is draw poker with the lowest hand winning the pot. Each player is dealt five cards \nfacedown, after which there is a betting round. Players are required to open with a bet or fold. The \nplayers who remain in the pot after the first betting round now have an option to improve their \nhand by replacing cards in their hands with new ones. This is the draw. T he game is normally \nplayed with one or more blinds, sometimes with an ante added. Some betting structures allow the \nbig blind to be called; other structures require the minimum open to be double the big blind. In \nlimit poker, the usual structure has the li mit double after the draw (Northern California is an \nexception). The most popular forms of lowball are ace -to-five lowball (also known as California \nlowball), and deuce -to-seven lowball (also known as Kansas City lowball). Ace -to-five lowball \ngets its name because the best hand at that form is 5-4-3-2-A. Deuce-to-seven lowball gets its name \nbecause the best hand at that form is 7 -5-4-3-2 (not of the same suit). For a further description of \nthe forms of lowball, please see the individual section for each game. All rules governing kill pots \nare listed in \u201cSection 13 \u2013 Kill Pots.\u201d \nRULES OF LOWBALL \n1. The rules governing misdeals for holdem and other button games will be used for lowball. \n[See \u201cSection 16 \u2013 Explanations,\u201d discussion #7, for more information on t his rule.] These \nrules governing misdeals are reprinted here for convenience. \n \u201cThe following circumstances cause a misdeal, provided attention is called to the error before \ntwo players have acted on their hands: \n(a) The first or second card of the hand has been exposed by a dealer error. \n(b) Two or more cards have been exposed by the dealer. \n(c) Two or more extra cards have been dealt in the starting hands of a game. \n(d) An incorrect number of cards has been dealt to a player, except the button may receive \none more card to complete a starting hand. \n(e) The button was out of position. \n(f) The first card was dealt to the wrong position. \n(g) Cards have been dealt out of the proper sequence. \n(h) Cards have been dealt to an empty seat or a player not entitled to a hand. \n(i) A player has been dealt out who is entitled to a hand. This player must be present at the \ntable or have posted a blind or ante.\u201d \n11-LOWBALL \n29 \n2. In limit play, a bet and four raises are allowed in multihanded pots. [See \u201cSection 16 \u2013 \nExplanations,\u201d discussion #6, for more information on this rule.] \n3. As a new player, you have two options: \n(a) To wait for the big blind. \n(b) To kill the pot for double the amount of the big blind. \n4. In a single-blind game, a player who has less than half a blind may receive a hand. However, \nthe next player is obligated to take the blind. If the all-in player wins the pot or buys in again, \nthat player will then be obligated to either take the blind on the next deal or sit out until due \nfor the big blind. \n5. In single-blind games, half a blind or more constitutes a full blind. \n6. In single-blind games, if you fail to take the blind, you may only be dealt in on the blind. \n7. In multiple-blind games, if the big blind passes your seat, you may either wait for the big blind \nor kill the pot in order to receive a hand. This does not apply if you have taken all of your \nblinds and changed seats. In this situation, you may be dealt in as soon as your position relative \nto the blinds entitles you to a hand (the button may go by you once without penalty). \n8. Before the draw, whether an exposed card must be taken depends on the form of lowball being \nplayed; see that form. (The player never has an option.) \n9. On the draw, an exposed card cannot be taken. The draw is completed to each player in order, \nand then the exposed card is replaced. \n10. A player may draw up to four consecutive cards. If a player wishes to draw five new cards, \nfour are dealt right away, and the fifth c ard after everyone else has drawn cards. If the last \nplayer wishes to draw five new cards, four are dealt right away, and a card is burned before \nthe player receives a fifth card. [See \u201cSection 16 \u2013 Explanations,\u201d discussion #9, for more \ninformation about this rule.] \n11. You may change the number of cards you wish to draw, provided: \n(a) No card has been dealt off the deck in response to your request (including the burncard). \n(b) No player has acted, in either the betting or indicating the number of cards to be drawn, \nbased on the number of cards you have requested. \n11-LOWBALL \n30 \n12. Five cards constitute a playing hand; more or fewer than five cards after the draw constitutes \na fouled hand. Before the draw, if you have fewer than five cards in your hand, you may \nreceive additional cards, provided no action has been taken by the first player to act (unless \nthat action occurs before the deal is completed). However, the dealer position may still receive \na missing fifth card, even if action has taken place. If action has been taken, you are entitled \non the draw to receive the number of cards necessary to complete a five-card hand. \n13. If you are asked how many cards you drew by another active player, you are obligated to \nrespond until there has been action after the draw, and the dealer is also obligated to respond. \nOnce there is any action after the draw, you are no longer obliged to respond and the dealer \ncannot respond. \n14. Rapping the table in turn constitutes either a pass or the declaration of a pat hand that does \nnot want to draw any cards, depending on the situation. \n15. Cards speak (cards read for themselves). However, you are not allowed to claim a better hand \nthan you hold. (Example: If a player calls an \"8\", that player must produce at least an \"8\" low \nor better to w in. But if a player erroneously calls the second card incorrectly, such as \u201c8 -6\u201d \nwhen actually holding an 8-7, no penalty applies.) If you miscall your hand and cause another \nplayer to foul his or her hand, your hand is dead. If both hands remain intact, t he best hand \nwins. If a miscalled hand occurs in a multihanded pot, the miscalled hand is dead, and the best \nremaining hand wins the pot. For your own protection, always hold your hand until you see \nyour opponent\u2019s cards. \n16. Any player spreading a hand with a pair in it must announce \"pair\" or risk losing the pot if it \ncauses any other player to foul a hand. If two or more hands remain intact, the best hand wins \nthe pot. \nACE-TO-FIVE LOWBALL \nIn ace-to-five lowball, the best hand is any 5-4-3-2-A. An ace is the lowest-ranking card. For hands \nwith a pair, A-A beats 2-2. Straights and flushes do not count against your hand. \n1. If a joker is used, it becomes the lowest card not present in your han d. The joker is assumed \nto be in use unless the contrary is posted. \n2. In limit play, check-raise is not permitted (unless the players are alerted that it is allowed). \n3. In limit ace-to-five lowball, before the draw, an exposed card of seven or under must be taken, \nand an exposed card higher than a seven must be replaced after the deal has been completed. \nThis first exposed card is used as the burncard. [See \u201cSection 16 \u2013 Explanations,\u201d discussion \n#8, for more information on this rule.] \n11-LOWBALL \n31 \n4. In limit play, the \u201csevens rule\u201d is assumed to be in use (the players should be alerted if it is \nnot). If you check a seven or better and it is the best hand, all action after the draw is void, \nand you cannot win any money on any subsequent bets. You are still eligible to win whatever \nexisted in the pot before the draw if you have the best hand. If you check a seven or better \nand the hand is beaten, you lose the pot and any additional calls you make. If there is an all -\nin bet after the draw that is less than half a bet, a seven or better may just call and win that \nbet. However, if another player overcalls this short bet and loses, the person who overcalls \nreceives the bet back. If the seven or better completes to a full bet, this fulfills all obligations. \nDEUCE-TO-SEVEN LOWBALL \nIn deuce-to-seven lowball (sometimes known as Kansas City lowball), in most respects, the worst \nconventional poker hand wins. Straights and flushes count against you, crippling the value of a \nhand. The ace is used only as a high card. Therefore, the best hand is 7-5-4-3-2, not all of the same \nsuit. The hand 5-4-3-2-A is not considered to be a straight, but an ace-5 high, so it beats other ace-\nhigh hands and pairs, but loses to king -high. A pair of aces is the highest pair, so it loses to any \nother pair. \nThe rules for deuce-to-seven lowball are the same as those for ace-to-five lowball, except for the \nfollowing differences: \n1. The best hand is 7-5-4-3-2 of at least two different suits. Straights and flushes count against \nyou, and aces are considered high only. \n2. Before the draw, an exposed card of 7, 5, 4, 3, or, 2 must be taken. Any other exposed card \nmust be replaced (including a 6). \n3. Check-raise is allowed on any hand after the draw. \n4. After the draw, a seven or better is not required to bet. \n11-LOWBALL \n32 \nNO-LIMIT AND POT-LIMIT LOWBALL \n1. All the rules for no-limit and pot-limit poker (see Section 14 - No-limit and Pot-limit) apply \nto no-limit and pot-limit lowball. All other lowball rules apply, except as noted. \n2. A player is not entitled to know that an opponent does not hold the best possible hand, so \nthese rules for exposed cards before the draw apply: \n(a) In ace-to-five lowball, a player must take an exposed card of A, 2, 3, 4, or 5, and any other \ncard must be replaced. \n(b) In deuce-to-seven lowball, the player must take an exposed card of 2, 3, 4, 5, or 7, and \nany other card including a 6 must be replaced. \n3. After the draw, any exposed card must be replaced. \n4. After the draw, a player may check any hand without penalty (The sevens rule is not used). \n5. Check-raise is allowed. \n \n33 \nSECTION 12 - DRAW HIGH \nThere are two betting rounds, one before the draw and one after the draw. The game is played with \na button and an ante. Players in turn may check, open for the minimum, or open with a raise. After \nthe first betting round the players have the opportunity to draw new cards to replace the ones they \ndiscard. Action after the draw starts with the opener, or next player proc eeding clockwise if the \nopener has folded. The betting limit after the draw is twice the amount of the betting limit before \nthe draw. Some draw high games allow a player to open on anything; others require the opener to \nhave a pair of jacks or better. \nRULES OF DRAW HIGH \n1. A maximum of a bet and four raises is permitted in multihanded pots. [See \u201cSection 16 \u2013 \nExplanations,\u201d discussion #6, for more information on this rule.] \n2. Check-raise is permitted both before and after the draw. \n3. The rules governing misdeals for hold\u2019em and other button games will be used for draw. \n4. Any card that is exposed by the dealer before the draw must be kept. \n5. Five cards constitute a playing hand. Less than five cards for a player (other than the button) \nbefore action has been taken is a misdeal. If action has been taken, a player with fewer than \nfive cards may draw the number of cards necessary to complete a five-card hand. The button \nmay receive the fifth card even if action has taken place. More or fewer than five cards after \nthe draw constitutes a fouled hand. \n6. A player may draw up to four consecutive cards. If a player wishes to draw five new cards, \nfour are dealt right away, and the fifth card after everyone else has drawn cards. If the last \nplayer wishes to draw five new cards, four are dealt right away, and a card is burned before \nthe player receives a fifth card. [See \u201cSection 16 \u2013 Explanations,\u201d discussion #9, for more \ninformation about this rule.] \n7. You may change the number of cards you wish to draw, provided: \n(a) No cards have been dealt off the deck in response to your request (including the burncard). \n(b) No player has acted, in either the betting or indicating the number of cards to be drawn , \nbased on the number of cards you have requested. \n8. On the draw, an exposed card cannot be taken. The draw is completed to each player in order, \nand then the exposed card is replaced. \n12-DRAW HIGH \n34 \n9. If you are asked how many cards you drew by another active player, you are obligated to \nrespond until there has been action after the draw, and the dealer is also obligated to respond. \nOnce there is any action after the draw, you are no longer obliged to respond and the dealer \ncannot respond. \n10. Rapping the table in turn constitutes either a pass or the declaration of a pat hand that does \nnot want to draw any cards, depending on the situation. A player who indicates a pat hand by \nrapping the table, not knowing the pot has been raised, may still play his or her hand. \n11. You may not change your seat between hands when there are multiple antes or forfeited \nmoney in the pot. \n12. You have the right to pay the ante (whether single or multiple) at any time and receive a hand, \nunless there is any additional money in the pot that has been forfeited during a hand in which \nyou were not involved. \n13. If the pot has been declared open by an all-in player playing for just the antes, all callers must \ncome in for the full opening bet. \n14. If you have only a full ante and no other chips on the table, you may play for just the antes. If \nno one opens and there is another ante, you may still play for that part of the antes that you \nhave matched, without putting in any more money. \nTHE JOKER \n1. The players will be alerted as to whether the joker is in use. \n2. The joker may be used only as an ace, or to complete a straight, flush, or straight flush. (Thus \nit is not a completely wild card.) \n3. If the joker is used to make a flush, it will be the highest card of the flush not present in the \nhand. \n4. Five aces is the best possible hand (four aces and joker). \n \n35 \nSECTION 13 - KILL POTS \nTo kill a pot means to post an overblind that increases the betting limit. A full kill is double the \namount of the big blind, and doubles the betting limits. A half kill is one-and-a-half times the big \nblind, and increases the betting limits by that amount. A kill may be optional in a game, and is \noften used at lowball when a player wants to be dealt in right away instead of waiting to take the \nbig blind. A kill may be required in a game for any time a specified event takes place. In high-low \nsplit games using a required kill, a player who scoops a pot bigger than a set size must kill the next \npot. In other games using a required kill, a player who wins two consecutive pots must kill the next \npot. In this type of kill game, a marker called a \u201ckill button\u201d indicates which player has won the \npot, and the winner keeps this marker until the next hand is completed. If the player who has the \nkill button wins a second consecutive pot and it qualifies monetarily, that player must kill the next \npot. \nRULES OF KILL POTS \n1. The kill button is neutral (belonging to no player) if: \n(a) It is the first hand of a new game. \n(b) The winner of the previous pot has quit the game. \n(c) The previous pot was split and neither player had the kill button. \n2. In a kill pot, the killer acts in proper turn (after the person on the immediate right). \n3. There is no pot -size requirement for the first pot or \"leg\" of a kill. For the second \"leg\" to \nqualify for a kill, you must win at least one full bet for whatever limit you are playing, and it \ncannot be any part of the blind structure. \n4. If a player with one \"leg up\" splits the next pot, that player still has a \"leg up\" for the next \nhand. If the player who split the pot was the kill in the previous hand, then that player must \nalso kill the next pot. \n5. A person who leaves the table with a \u201cleg up\u201d toward a kill still has a \u201cleg up\u201d upon returning \nto the game. \n6. A player who is required to post a kill must do so that same hand even if wishing to quit or be \ndealt out. A player who fails to post a required kill blind will not be allowed to participate in \nany game until the kill money is posted. \n7. Kill blinds are considered part of the pot. If a player with a required kill wins again, then that \nplayer must kill it again (for the same amount as the previous hand). \n13 KILL POTS \n36 \n8. When a player wins both the high and the low pot (\u201cscoops\u201d) in a split -pot game with a kill \nprovision, the next hand will be killed only if the pot is at least five times the size of the upper \nlimit of the game. \n9. If you are unaware that the pot has been killed and put in a lesser amount, If it is a required \nkill pot with the kill button faceup, you must put in the corre ct amount. If not, you may \nwithdraw the chips and reconsider your action. \n10. In lowball, an optional rule is allowing players to look at their first two cards and then opt \nwhether to kill the pot. The pot may no longer be killed if any player in the game has received \na third card. In order to kill the pot voluntarily, you must have at least four times the amount \nof the kill blind in your stack. For example: If the big blind is two chips, and the kill blind is \nfour chips, the voluntary killer must have at least 16 chips prior to posting the kill. If this rule \nis used, it is in conjunction with having the killer act last on the first betting round rather than \nin proper order. \n11. Only one kill is allowed per deal. \n12. A new player is not entitled to play in a killed pot, but may do so by agreeing to kill the next \npot. \n13. Broken game status is allowed only for players of the same limit and game type. For this \npurpose, a game with a required kill is considered a different type of game than an otherwise \nsimilar game without a required kill. \n \n37 \nSECTION 14 - NO LIMIT AND POT-LIMIT \nA no-limit or pot-limit betting structure for a game gives it a different character from limit poker, \nrequiring a separate set of rules in many situations. All the rules for limit games apply to no-limit \nand pot-limit games, except as noted in this section. No-limit means that the amount of a wager is \nlimited only by the table stakes rule, so any part or all of a player\u2019s chips may be wagered. The \nrules of no-limit play also apply to po t-limit play, except that a bet may not exceed the pot size. \nThe player is responsible for determining the pot size at no -limit, not the dealer. The dealer is \nresponsible for determining the pot size at pot-limit, and should enforce the pot-size cap on wagers \nwithout waiting to be asked to do so by a player. For those rules that apply only to no -limit and \npot-limit lowball, see the sub-section at the end of \u201cSection 11 \u2013 Lowball.\u201d \nNO-LIMIT RULES \n1. The number of raises in any betting round is unlimited. \n2. The minimum bet size is the amount of the minimum bring-in, unless the player is going all-\nin. The minimum bring-in is the size of the big blind unless the structure of the game is preset \nby the house to some other amount (such as double the big blind). The minimum bet remains \nthe same amount on all betting rounds. If the big blind does not have sufficient chips to post \nthe required amount, a player who enters the pot on the initial betting round is still required \nto enter for at least the minimum bet (unless going all-in for a lesser sum) and a preflop raiser \nmust at least double the size of the big blind. At all other times, when someone goes all-in for \nless than the minimum bet, a player has the option of just calling the all-in amount. If a player \ngoes all-in for an amount that is less than the minimum bet, a player who wishes to raise must \nraise at least the amount of the minimum bet. For example, if the minimum bet is $100, and a \nplayer goes all-in on the flop for $20, a player may fold, call $20, or raise to at least a total of \n$120. \n3. All raises must be equal to or greater than the size of the previous bet or raise on that betting \nround, except for an all -in wager. Example: Player A bets 100 and player B raises to 200. \nPlayer C wishing to raise mus t raise at least 100 more, making the total bet at least 300. A \nplayer who has already acted and is not facing a fullsize wager may not subsequently raise an \nall-in bet that is less than the minimum bet or less than the full size of the last bet or raise. \n(The half-the-size rule for reopening the betting is for limit poker only.) \n4. Multiple all-in wagers, each of an amount too small to qualify as a raise, still act as a raise \nand reopen the betting if the resulting wager size to a player qualifies as a rai se. Example: \nPlayer A bets $100 and Player B raises $100 more, making the total bet $200. If Player C goes \nall in for less than $300 total (not a full $100 raise), and Player A calls, then Player B has no \noption to raise again, because he wasn\u2019t fully rais ed. (Player A could have raised, because \nPlayer B raised.) \n14 NO-LIMIT AND POT-LIMIT \n38 \n5. \u201cCompleting the bet\u201d is a limit poker wager type only, and not used at big-bet poker. \n6. At non-tournament play, a player who says \"raise\" is allowed to continue putting chips into \nthe pot with more than one move; the wager is assumed complete when the player\u2019s hands \ncome to rest outside the pot area. (This rule is used because no-limit play may require a large \nnumber of chips be put into the pot.) In tournament play, the TDA rules require that the player \neither use a verbal statement giving the amount of the raise or put the chips into the pot in a \nsingle motion, to avoid making a string-bet. \n7. A wager is not binding until the chips are actually released into the pot, unless the player has \nmade a verbal statement of action. \n8. If there is a discrepancy between a player's verbal statement and the amount put into the pot, \nthe bet will be corrected to the verbal statement. \n9. If a call is short due to a counting error, the amount must be corrected, even if the bettor has \nshown down a superior hand. \n10. A bet of a single chip or bill without comment is considered to be the full amount of the chip \nor bill allowed. However, a player acting on a previous bet with a larger denomination chip \nor bill is calling the previous bet unless this player makes a verbal declaration to raise the pot. \n(This includes acting on the forced bet of the big blind.) \n11. If a player tries to bet or raise less than the legal minimum and has more chips, the wager must \nbe increased to the proper size (but no greater). This does not apply to a player who has \nunintentionally put too much in to call. \n12. Because the amount of a wager at big-bet poker has such a wide range, a player who has taken \naction based on a gross misunderstanding of the amount wagered may receive some protection \nby the decision-maker. A \"call\" or \u201craise\u201d may be ruled not binding if it is obvious that the \nplayer grossly misunderstood the amount wagered, provided no damage has been caused by \nthat action. Example: Player A bets $300, player B reraises to $1200, and Player C puts $300 \ninto the pot and says, \u201ccall.\u201d It is obvious that player C believes the bet to be only $300 and \nhe should be allowed to withdraw his $300 and reconsider his wager. A bettor should not \nshow down a hand until the amount put into the pot for a call seems reasonably correct, or it \nis obvious that the caller understands the amount wagered. The decision -maker is allowed \nconsiderable discretion in ruling on this type of situation. A possible ru le-of-thumb is to \ndisallow any claim of not understanding the amount wagered if the caller has put eighty \npercent or more of that amount into the pot. \n14 NO-LIMIT AND POT-LIMIT \n39 \nExample: On the end, a player puts a $500 chip into the pot and says softly, \u201cFour hundred.\u201d \nThe opponent puts a $100 chip into the pot and says, \u201cCall.\u201d The bettor immediately shows \nthe hand. The dealer says, \u201cHe bet four hundred.\u201d The caller says, \u201cOh, I thought he bet a \nhundred.\u201d In this case, the recommended ruling normally is that the bettor had an oblig ation \nto not show the hand when the amount put into the pot was obviously short, and the \u201ccall\u201d can \nbe retracted. Note that the character of each player can be a factor. (Unfortunately, situations \ncan arise at big-bet poker that are not so clear-cut as this.) \n13. All wagers may be required to be in the same denomination of chip (or larger) used for the \nminimum bring-in, even if smaller chips are used in the blind structure. If this is done, the \nsmaller chips do not play except in quantity, even when going all-in. \n14. Since all a player\u2019s chips may be put at risk on a hand, the house has the right to set a maximum \namount for the buy-in to help control the effective size of a game. \n15. In non-tournament games, one optional live straddle is allowed. The player who posts the \nstraddle has last action for the first round of betting and is allowed to raise. To straddle, a \nplayer must be on the immediate left of the big blind, and must post an amount twice the size \nof the big blind. A straddle bet sets a new minimum bring-in; it is not treated as a raise. \n16. In all no-limit and pot-limit games, the house has the right to place a maximum time limit for \ntaking action on your hand. The clock may be put on someone by the dealer as directed by a \nfloorperson, if a player requests it. If the clock is put on you when you are facing a bet, you \nwill have one additional minute to act on your hand. You will have a ten -second warning, \nafter which your hand is dead if you have not acted. \n17. The cardroom does not condone \"insuranc e\" or any other \u201cproposition\u201d wagers. The \nmanagement declines to make decisions in such matters, and the pot will be awarded to the \nbest hand. Players are asked to refrain from instigating proposition wagers in any form. The \nplayers are allowed to agree to deal twice (or three times) when someone is all -in. \u201cDealing \ntwice\u201d means the pot is divided in two, with each portion being dealt for separately. \n14 NO-LIMIT AND POT-LIMIT \n40 \nPOT-LIMIT RULES \nA bet may not exceed the pot size. The maximum amount a player can raise is the amount in t he \npot after the call is made. Therefore, if a pot is $100, and someone makes a $50 bet, the next player \ncan call $50 and raise the pot $200, for a total wager of $250. \n1. If a wager is made that exceeds the pot size, the surplus will be given back to the bettor as \nsoon as possible, and the amount will be reduced to the maximum allowable. \n2. The dealer or any player in the game can and should call attention to a wager that appears to \nexceed the pot size (this also applies to heads-up pots). The oversize wager may be corrected \nat any point until all players have acted on it. \n3. If an oversize wager has stood for a length of time with someone considering what action to \ntake, that person has had to act on a wager that was thought to be a certain size. If the player \nthen decides to call or raise, and attention is called at this late point to whether this is an \nallowable amount, the floorperson may rule that the oversize amount must stand (especially \nif the person now trying to reduce the amount is the person that made the wager). \n4. In pot-limit play, it is advisable in many structures to round off the pot size upward to produce \na faster pace of play. This is done by treating any odd amount as the next larger size. For \nexample, if the pot size was being kept track of with $25 units, then a pot size of $80 would \nbe treated as a pot size of $100. \n5. In pot-limit hold\u2019em and pot-limit Omaha money games, many structures treat the little blind \nas if it were the same size of the big blind in computing pot size. In such a structure, a player \ncan open for a maximum of four times the size of the big blind. For example, if the blinds are \n$5 and $10, a player may open with a raise to $40. (The range of options is to either open with \na call of $10, or raise in increments of five dollars to any amount from $20 to $40.) Subsequent \nplayers also treat the $5 as if it were $10 in computing the pot size, until the big blind is \nthrough acting on the first betting round. This rule of treating the little blind as if it were the \nsize of the big blind is especially desirable in a structure where the little blind uses a lower -\ndenomination chip than the big blind, as in using blinds of $10 and $25 (two $5 chips and a \n$25 chip). At tournament play, strict pot-limit rules are normally used, so there the maximum \nopening wager is 3.5 times the size of the big blind. \n6. In pot-limit, a player who puts a chip or a bill larger than the pot size into the pot without \ncomment is considered to be making a bet of the pot size (unless he is facing a bet). \n \n41 \nSECTION 15 - TOURNAMENTS \nBy participating in a tournament, you agree to abide by the rules and behave in a courteous manner. \nA violator may be verbally warned, suspended from play for a specified length of time, or \ndisqualified from the tournament. Chips from a disqualified participant will be removed from play. \nPlayers, whether in the hand or not, may not discuss the hands until the action is complete. Players \nare obligated to protect the other players in the tournament at all times. Discussing cards discarded \nor hand possibilities is not allowed. A penalty may be given for discussion of hands during the \nplay. \n1. Whenever possible, all rules are the same as those that apply to live games. \n2. Initial seating is determined by random draw or assignment. (For a one -table satellite event, \ncards to determine seating may be left faceup so the earlier entrants can pick their seat, since \nthe button is assigned randomly.) \n3. A change of seat is not allowed after play starts, except as assigned by the director. \n4. The appropriate starting amount of chips will be placed on the table for each paid entrant at \nthe beginning of the event, whether the person is present or not. \n5. If a paid entrant is absent at the start of an event, at some point an effort will be made to locate \nand contact the player. If the player requests the chips be left in place until arrival, the request \nwill be honored. If the player is unable to be contacted, the chips may be removed from play \nat the discretion of the director anytime after a new betting level is begun or a half -hour has \nelapsed, whichever occurs first. \n6. A starting stack of chips may be placed in a seat to accommodate late entrants (so all antes and \nblinds have been appropriately paid). An unsold seat will have such a stack removed at a time \nleft to the discretion of the director. \n7. A no-show or absent player is always dealt a hand. That player\u2019s stack will post chips for blinds \nand antes, and have the forced lowcard bet put into the pot at stud. \n8. In all tournament games using a dealer button, the starting position of the button is determined \nby the players drawing for the high card. \n9. Limits and blinds are raised at regularly scheduled intervals. \n10. If there is a signal designating the end of a betting level, the new limits apply on the next deal. \n(A deal begins with the first riffle of the shuffle.) \n15-TOURNAMENTS \n42 \n11. The lowest denomination of chip in play will be removed from the table when it is no longer \nneeded in the blind or ante structure. All lower -denomination chips that are of sufficient \nquantity for a new chip will be changed up directly. The method for removal of odd chips is to \ndeal one card to a player for each odd chip possessed. Cards are dealt clockwise starting with \nthe 1-seat, with each player receiving all cards before any cards are dealt to the next player. A \nplayer may not be eliminated from the event b y the chip -change process. If a player has no \nchips after the race has been held, he will be given a chip of the higher denomination before \nanyone else is awarded a chip. Next, the player with the highest card by suit gets enough odd \nchips to exchange for one new chip, the second-highest card gets to exchange for the next chip, \nand so forth, until all the lower-denomination chips are exchanged. If an odd number of lower-\ndenomination chips are left after this process, the player with the highest card remaini ng will \nreceive a new chip if he has half or more of the quantity of lower-denomination chips needed, \notherwise nothing. \n12. A player must be present at the table to stop the action by calling \u201ctime.\u201d \n13. A player must be at the table by the time all players have their complete starting hands in order \nto have a live hand for that deal. (The dealer has been instructed to kill the hands of all absent \nplayers immediately after dealing each player a starting hand.) \n14. As players are eliminated, tables are brok en in a pre -set order, with players from the broken \ntables assigned to empty seats at other tables. \n15. In button games, if a player is needed to move from a table to balance tables, the player due \nfor the big blind will be automatically selected to move, and will be given the earliest seat due \nfor the big blind if more than one seat is open. \n16. New players to a table as a result of balancing tables are dealt in immediately unless they are \nin the small blind or button position, where they must wait until t he button has passed to the \nplayer on their left. \n17. The number of players at each table will be kept reasonably balanced by the transfer of a player \nas needed. With more than six tables, table size will be kept within two players. With six tables \nor less, table size will be kept within one player. \n18. In all events, there is a redraw for seating when the field is reduced to three tables, two tables, \nand one table. (Redrawing at three tables is not mandatory in small tournaments with only four \nor five starting tables.) \n15-TOURNAMENTS \n43 \n19. If a player lacks sufficient chips for a blind or a forced bet, the player is entitled to get action \non whatever amount of money is left in his stack. A player who posts a short blind and wins \ndoes not need to make up the blind. \n20. A player who declares all in and loses the pot, then discovers that one or more chips were \nhidden, is not entitled to benefit from this. That player is eliminated from the tournament if the \nopponent had sufficient chips to cover the hidden ones (A rebuy is okay if allowable by the \nrules of that event). If another deal has not yet started, the director may rule the chips belong \nto the opponent who won that pot, if that obviously would have happened with the chips out \nin plain view. If the next deal has started, t he discovered chips are removed from the \ntournament. \n21. All players must leave their seat immediately after being eliminated from an event. \n22. Showing cards from a live hand during the action injures the rights of other players still \ncompeting in an event, who wish to see contestants eliminated. A player in a multihanded pot \nmay not show any cards during a deal. Heads-up, a player may not show any cards unless the \nevent has only two remaining players, or is winner -take-all. If a player deliberately shows a \ncard, the player may be penalized (but his hand will not be ruled dead). Verbally stating one\u2019s \nhand during the play may be penalized. \n23. The limitation on the number of raises at limit poker is also applied to heads -up situations \n(except the last two players in a tournament are exempted from a limitation on raises). \n24. At pot-limit and no-limit play, the player must either use a verbal statement giving the amount \nof the raise or put chips into the pot in a single motion. Otherwise, it is a string bet. \n25. Non-tournament chips are not allowed on the table. \n26. Higher-denomination chips must be placed where they are easily visible to all other players. \n27. All tournament chips must remain visible on the table throughout the event. Chips taken off \nthe table will be removed from the event, and a player doing this may be disqualified. \n28. Inappropriate behavior like throwing cards that go off the table may be punished with a penalty \nsuch as being dealt out for a length of time or number of hands. A severe inf raction such as \nabusive or disruptive behavior may be punished by eviction from the tournament. \n29. The decks is changed only when dealers change, unless a card is damaged. \n30. The dealer button remains in position until the appropriate blinds are taken. Players must post \nall blinds every round. Because of this, last action may be given to the same player for two \n15-TOURNAMENTS \n44 \nconsecutive hands by the use of a \u201cdead button.\u201d [See \u201cSection 16 \u2013 Explanations,\u201d discussion \n#1, for more information on this rule.] \n31. In heads-up play with two blinds, the small blind is on the button. When play becomes heads-\nup, the player who had the big blind the most recently is given the button, and his opponent is \ngiven the big blind. \n32. At stud, if a downcard on the initial hand is dealt faceup, a misdeal is called. \n33. If a player announces the intent to rebuy before cards are dealt, that player is playing behind \nand is obligated to make the rebuy. \n34. All hands will be turned faceup whenever a player is all-in and betting action is complete. \n35. If multiple players go broke on the same hand, the player starting the hand with the larger \namount of chips finishes in the higher place for prize money and any other award. Players \neliminated on the same deal who start their final hand with an e qual amount of chips receive \nequal prize money, with the best hand on that deal receiving any non-divisible award. \n36. Management is not required to rule on any private deals, side bets, or redistribution of the prize \npool among finalists. \n37. Private agreements by remaining players in an event regarding distribution of the prize pool \nare not condoned. (However, if such an agreement is made, the director has the option of \nensuring that it is carried out by paying those amounts.) Any private agre ement that does not \ninclude one or more active competitors is improper by definition. \n38. A tournament event is expected to be played until completion. A private agreement that \nremoves all prize money from being at stake in the competition is unethical. \n39. Management retains the right to cancel any event, or alter it in a manner fair to the players. \n \n45 \nSECTION 16 - EXPLANATIONS \n1. The only place in this set of rules that an alternative is mentioned other than in this section is \nin the method of button a nd blind placement. That rule (the first rule in \u201cSection 4 \u2013 Button \nand Blind Use\u201d) is repeated in an abbreviated version below for convenience. \n\u201cEach round all players must get the button, and meet the total amount of the blind obligations. \nEither of the following methods of button and blind placement may be used: \n(a) Moving button \u2013 The button always moves forward to the next player and the blinds adjust \naccordingly. There may be more than one big blind. \n(b) Dead button \u2013 The big blind is posted by the p layer due for it, and the small blind and \nbutton are positioned accordingly, even if this means the small blind or the button is placed \nin front of an empty seat, giving a player last action on consecutive hands.\u201d \nPoker tradition has a lot to do with the f act that both of these methods are in widespread use, \nbut neither method is superior in all situations. The moving button makes sure no player gets \nthe advantage of last action twice on a round (a big advantage at no -limit or pot -limit play). \nOn the other hand, a player may get to post a blind when on the button, which is more \nadvantageous than posting in front of the button. The moving button creates a situation where \ntwo big blinds may be posted on a deal, which speeds up the action. At tournament play th is \nspeed-up can be undesirable, as when dealing is being done hand-for-hand to balance the pace \nof play between two remaining tables. A cardroom may either decide for the sake of simplicity \nto use only one method, or decide to tailor the method to the game and situation. \n2. Most poker rule sets say you have a dead hand at the showdown if you do not have the proper \nnumber of cards for that game. At stud, this rule is too strict. An inexperienced player \nsometimes does not pay sufficient attention to the final card when holding a big hand like a \nflush or full house (where improvement is neither likely to happen nor be needed), and fails \nto protect that card. If the dealer erroneously puts that final card into the muck after the player \nfails to take it in, the rules should give the decision-maker an option to rule such a hand live. \nRule 18 in \u201cSection 8 \u2013 Seven-card Stud\u201d reads as below: \n\u201cA hand with more than seven cards is dead. A hand with less than seven cards at the \nshowdown is dead, except any player missing a seventh card may have the hand ruled live.\u201d \n3. This rulebook requires all cash to be changed into chips. In some cardrooms this may be \nimpractical. If the cardroom chooses to allow cash, only $100 bills should be permitted. \n16-EXPLANATIONS \n46 \n4. The rules given for rectifying a holdem situation where the dealer has dealt the flop or another \nboardcard before all the betting action on a round are inferior, because the dealer is told to not \nburn a card on a redeal. Since the \u201cno burn\u201d rule is so common, there was no choice but to use \nit here. It would be better for poker if the rule were changed to always burning a card. Here are \nthese rules (the third rule and fourth rule in \u201cSection 5 \u2013 Holdem\u201d). \n\u201cIf the cards are flopped before the betting is complete, or if the flop contains too many cards, \nthe boardcards are mixed with the remainder of the deck. The burncard remains on the table. \nAfter shuffling, the dealer cuts the deck and deals a new flop without burning a card.\u201d \n\u201cIf the dealer turns the fourth card on the board before the betting round is complete, the card \nis taken out of play for that round, even if subsequent players elect to fold. The betting is then \ncompleted. The dealer burns and turns what would have been the fifth card in the fourth card\u2019s \nplace. After this round of betting, the dealer reshuffles the deck, including the card that was \ntaken out of play, but not including the burncards or discards. The dealer then cuts the deck \nand turns up the final card without burning a card. \nThe portion of this rule saying the dealer does not burn a card on the redeal is inferior. It is \nharder for the dealer to control the card to be dealt if a burn is required. The sentence in the \nrule should read, \u201cThe dealer then cuts the deck, burns a card, and turns the final card.\u201d \nThe present method for handling a premature dealing on the turn is used to have what would \nhave been the last board -card used on the turn, and not reshuffling the deck until just before \nthe last card is dealt. This method has four-fifths of the boardcards remaining the same, albeit \nin a different order. It would be better to reshuffle before the turn, preserving the chance of \nreceiving the prematurely dealt card on either of the last two cards, as opposed to cutting that \nchance in half. The superiority of reshuffling right away is illustrated if the prematurely dealt \ncard makes a gutshot straight-flush for a player. \n5. Rule seven in \u201cSection 4 \u2013 Button and Blind Use\u201d says, \u201cA new player cannot be dealt in \nbetween the big blind and the button. Blinds may not be made up between the big blind and \nthe button. You must wait until the button passes.\u201d This rule is standard practice, but allowing \na new player or player making up blinds to come in between the blinds is better (if dealers are \ntrained how to handle the resulting situations), because it gets players eager to join or rejoin \nthe game into action faster. \n16-EXPLANATIONS \n47 \n6. Most poker rulebooks follow the usual California practice in multihanded pots at limit poker \nof allowing a bet and six raises for lowball and draw high. The number of allowable raises for \nthose games is given in this rulebook as a bet and four raises because this cuts down on the \neffect of collusion between players, and more raises than four are hardly ever needed to define \nthe strength of two hands when another player is calling. \n7. Lowball has historically had less stringent demands on the order of cards or acceptability of \nexposed cards than in most other poker forms. This rulebook follows the modern tre nd at \nlowball regarding misdeals of requiring the cards to be dealt facedown and in proper order. \n8. At ace-to-five limit lowball, an exposed card rule used less often, but probably a superior rule, \nis to not let a player take an exposed six or seven (the rule for no-limit ace-to-five lowball). If \na player gets to keep only a card that might make a perfect hand, having a card exposed is less \nadvantageous, and the opponent must consider the chance of a perfect hand. \n9. At lowball and draw high, some rule set s allow a player to draw five consecutive cards. The \nrule used here disallowing this makes cheating more difficult. Our rule #10 in lowball and rule \n#5 in draw high says, \u201cA player may draw up to four consecutive cards. If a player wishes to \ndraw five new cards, four are dealt right away, and the fifth card after everyone else has drawn \ncards. If the last player wishes to draw five new cards, four are dealt right away, and a card is \nburned before the player receives a fifth card.\u201d \n \n48 \nGLOSSARY \nACTION: A f old, check, call, bet, or raise.

He is the person who has \nselected which rules to use, and formatted, organized, and worded the text. Nearly all \nthese rules are substantively in common use for poker, but many improved ideas for \nwording and organization are employed throughout this work. A lot of the rules are \nsimilar to those used in the rulebook of cardrooms where he has acted as a rules \nconsultant and rules drafter. Ciaffone authored the rulebook for the Poker Players \nAssociation (founded in 1984, now defunct), the first comprehensive set of poker rules \nfor the general public. He has done extensive work on rules for the Las Vegas Hilton, \nThe Mirage, and Hollywood Park Casino, and assisted many other cardrooms. Ciaffone \nis a regular columnist for Card Player magazine, and can be reached through that \npublication. This rulebook will be periodically revised, so suggestions are welcome. \nPoker rules are widely used and freely copied, so it is impossible to construct a rulebook \nwithout using many rules that exist as part of a rule set of some cardroom. If such a \nrule is used, no credit is given to the source (which is unlikely to be the original one for \nthe rule). \nWarning! Anyone contemplating the hosting of a private game should make sure what \nhe is doing is not in violation of the law. Most laws governing private poker games are \nmade at the state level. No state in our country allows a person to run a poker game as \na business. Raking pots and charging an hourly rate for playing are two examples of \nactivities only a licensed commercial cardroom would be allowed to do. So me states \nprohibit the playing of poker for money, because they prohibit any kind of gambling. \nOther states allow social gambling. Even though gambling laws may sometimes \nenforced only sporadically, they do exist, and people are prosecuted for violating th em. \nCheck out the penal code in your state and protect yourself, your family, and your \nfriends by obeying the law. This rulebook is not to be construed in any way as an aid to \nbreaking the law. It\u2019s purpose is simply to maintain order by providing a fair f ramework \nfor playing poker in a situation where the game is legal. \nThis rulebook for private games was made by taking the document constructed for \ncardroom use and making the appropriate changes. Most of those changes are in \nwording, but there are a few of substance. Here are some examples. A warning is given \nregarding the legality of hosting a poker game. The restriction on the maximum number \nof raises on a betting round was set at a bet and three raises for all limit poker forms, \nwhich is the traditional rule for private games. The procedure for shuffling and cutting is \ndescribed. The time one may be gone from a game has been shortened. \nThis rulebook is copyright protected. It may not be used for any commercial purpose \nwithout the specific consent of Robert Ciaffone, its author. \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n (1) PROPER BEHAVIOR ............................. 1 \n Conduct Code 1 \n Poker Etiquette 1 \n (2) HOUSE POLICIES ................................. 3 \n Decision-Making 3 \n Procedures 3 \n Seating 6 \n(3) GENERAL POKER RULES ................... 8 \nThe Buy-In 8 \nThe Shuffle and Cut 8 \nMisdeals 8 \nDead Hands 9 \nIrregularities 10 \nBetting and Raising 11 \nThe Showdown 13 \nTies 14 \n(4) BUTTON AND BLIND USE .................... 16 \n(5) HOLD\u2019EM ............................................... 19 \n(6) OMAHA .................................................. 21 \n(7) OMAHA HIGH-LOW ............................... 22 \n(8) SEVEN-CARD STUD ............................. 23 \n(9) RAZZ (SEVEN-CARD STUD LOW) ....... 27 \n(10) SEVEN-CARD STUD HIGH-LOW .......... 28 \n(11) LOWBALL .............................................. 30 \n Ace-to-five Lowball 33 \n Deuce-to-seven Lowball 33 \n No-limit and Pot-limit Lowball 34 \n(12) DRAW HIGH ........................................... 35 \n Jacks-or-Better 36 \n The Joker 38 \n(13) KILL POTS ............................................. 39 \n(14) NO-LIMIT AND POT-LIMIT .................... 41 \n Pot-limit 43 \n(15) TOURNAMENTS ................................... 45 \n(16) EXPLANATIONS ................................... 48 \n GLOSSARY ........................................... 51 \n \n1 \n1 - PROPER BEHAVIOR \nCONDUCT CODE \nWe will attempt to maintain a pleasant environment for all our players, but are not \nresponsible for the conduct of any player. We have established a code of conduct, and \nmay deny the privilege to play in our game to anyone who violates it. The following is \nnot permitted: \nCollusion with another player or any other form of cheating. \nVerbally or physically threatening anyone. \nUsing profanity or obscene language. \nCreating a disturbance by arguing, shouting, or making excessive noise. \nThrowing, tearing, bending, or crumpling cards. \nDestroying or defacing property. \nUsing an illegal substance. \nCarrying a weapon. \nPOKER ETIQUETTE \nThe following actions are improper, and grounds for warning, suspending, or barring a \nviolator: \nDeliberately acting out of turn. \nDeliberately splashing chips into the pot. \nAgreeing to check a hand out when a third player is all-in. \nReading a hand for another player at the showdown before it has been placed faceup \non the table. \nTelling anyone to turn a hand faceup at the showdown. \nPROPER BEHAVIOR \n2 \nRevealing the contents of a live hand in a multihanded pot before the betting is \ncomplete. \nNeedlessly stalling the action of a game. \nDeliberately discarding hands away from the muck. Cards should be released in a low \nline of flight, at a moderate rate of speed. \nStacking chips in a manner that interferes with dealing or viewing cards. \nMaking statements or taking actio n that could unfairly influence the course of play, \nwhether or not the offender is involved in the pot. \n \n3 \n2 \u2013 HOUSE POLICIES \nDECISION-MAKING \n1. Taking a seat in a poker game means you agree to abide by the rules for that game \nand the decision-making process used in it. \n2. The proper time to draw attention to an error or irregularity is when it occurs or is \nfirst noticed. Any delay may affect the ruling. \n3. If an incorrect rule interpretation or decision is made in good faith, there shall be no \nliability incurred by the decision-maker. \n4. A ruling may be made regarding a pot if it has been requested before the next deal \nstarts (or before the game either ends or changes to another table). Otherwise, the \nresult of a deal must stand. The first riffle of the shuffle marks the start for a deal. \n5. If a pot has been incorrectly awarded and mingled with chips that were not in the \npot, but the time limit for a ruling request given in the previous rule has been \ncomplied with, the betting may be reconstructed, and the p roper amount transferred \nto the respective players. \n6. To keep the action moving, it is possible that a game may continue even though a \ndecision is delayed for a short period. In such circumstances, a pot or portion \nthereof may be impounded while the decision is pending. \n7. The same action may have a different meaning, depending on who does it, so the \npossible intent of an offender will be taken into consideration. Some factors here \nare the person\u2019s amount of poker experience and past record. \nPROCEDURES \n1. The poker form and stakes that had been agreed upon when the game was started \nshall not be changed if more than one player objects. \n2. Cash is not permitted on the table. All cash should be changed into chips in order to \nplay. \nHOUSE POLICIES \n4 \n3. The establishment is not responsible for any shortage or removal of chips left on the \ntable during a player\u2019s absence, even though everyone should try to protect the \ngame as best they can. \n4. All games are table stakes. Only the chips in front of a player at the start of a deal \nmay play for that hand, except for chips not yet received that a player has \npurchased. The amount bought must be announced to the table, or only the amoun t \nof the minimum buy-in plays. \n5. If you return to the game within one hour of cashing out, your buy -in must be equal to \nthe amount removed when leaving that game. \n6. All chips must be kept in plain view. \n7. Playing out of a chip rack is not allowed. \n8. Only one person may play a hand. \n9. No one is allowed to play another player\u2019s chips. \n10. Playing over may be allowed if that is customary, but only with permission from the \nabsent player (unless he has left the premises for some length of time) and \nprotection for that person\u2019s chips. \n11. Pushing bets (\u201csaving\u201d or \u201cpotting out\u201d) is not allowed. \n12. Pushing an ante or posting for another person is not allowed. \n13. Splitting pots by agreement will not be allowed. Chopping the big and small blind by \ntaking them back when all other players have folded may be allowed in non -\ntournament button games, if that is customary. \n14. Insurance propositions are not allowed. Dealing twice (or three times) when all -in is \npermitted at big-bet poker. \n15. Players must keep their cards in full view. This means above table -level and not \npast the edge of the table. The cards should not be covered by the hands in a \nmanner to completely conceal them. \nHOUSE POLICIES \n5 \n16. Any player is entitled to a clear view of an opponent\u2019s chips. Higher denomination \nchips should be easily visible. \n17. Your chips may be picked up if you are away from the table for more t han 15 \nminutes, unless you have made a specific arrangement to leave for a longer length \nof time. Frequent absences may cause your chips to be removed from the table. \n18. A new deck must be used for at least a full round (once around the table) before it \nmay be changed, unless a deck is defective or damaged, or cards become sticky. \n19. Looking through the discards or deck stub is not allowed. \n20. A player is expected to pay attention to the game and not hold up play. Activity that \ninterferes with this such as reading at the table is discouraged, and the player will \nbe asked to cease if a problem is caused. \n21. A non-player may not sit at the table. \n22. You may have a guest sit behind you only if no one in the game objects. It is \nimproper for a guest to look at any hand other then your own. \n23. Speaking in a foreign language during a deal is not allowed. \nSEATING \n1. When a button game starts, active players will draw a card for the button position. \nThe button will be awarded to the highest card by suit. \n2. In s tarting a game, the player who arrives the earliest gets first choice of remaining \nseats. A certain seat may be reserved for a player for good reason. Example: to \nassist in ease of reading the board for a person with a vision problem. \n3. A player who is al ready in the game has precedence over a new player for any seat \nwhen it becomes available. However, no change will occur after a new player has \nbeen seated and received chips. For players already in the game, the one who asks \nthe earliest has preference for a seat change. \n \n6 \nSECTION 3 - GENERAL POKER RULES \nTHE BUY-IN \n1. When you enter a game, you must make a full buy -in for that particular game. A full \nbuy-in at limit poker is at least ten times the maximum bet for the game being \nplayed, unless designated oth erwise. A full buy -in at pot -limit or no -limit poker is \nforty times the minimum bring -in (usually, the size of the big blind), unless \ndesignated otherwise. \n2. Only one short buy-in is allowed per session. \n3. Adding to your stack is not considered a buy -in, and may be done in any quantity \nbetween hands. \nTHE SHUFFLE AND CUT \n1. The pack must be shuffled and cut before the cards are dealt. The recommended \nmethod to protect the integrity of the game is to have three people involved instead \nof only two. The deale r on the previous hand takes in the discards and squares up \nthe deck prior to the shuffle. The player on the new dealer\u2019s left shuffles the cards \nand then slides the pack to the new dealer, who gets them cut by the player on his \nright. \n2. The deck must be riffled a minimum of four times. The cut must leave a minimum of \nfour cards in each portion. \n3. The bottom of the deck should be protected so nobody can see the bottom card. This \nis done by using a cut-card. A joker may be used as a cut-card. \n4. Any compla int about the shuffle, cut, or other preparation connected with dealing \nmust be made before the player has looked at his hand or betting action has started. \nMISDEALS \n1. The following circumstances cause a misdeal, provided attention is called to the \nerror before two players have acted on their hands. (If two players have acted in \nturn, the deal must be played to conclusion, as explained in rule #2) \nGENERAL POKER RULES \n7 \n(a) The first or second card of the hand has been dealt faceup or exposed through \ndealer error. \n(b) Two or more cards have been exposed by the dealer. \n(c) Two or more boxed cards (improperly faced cards) are found. \n(d) Two or more extra cards have been dealt in the starting hands of a game. \n(e) An incorrect number of cards has been dealt to a player, except the to p card may \nbe dealt if it goes to the player in proper sequence. \n(f) Any card has been dealt out of the proper sequence (except an exposed card may \nbe replaced by the burncard). \n(g) The button was out of position. \n(h) The first card was dealt to the wrong position. \n(i) Cards have been dealt to an empty seat or a player not entitled to a hand. \n(j) A player has been dealt out who is entitled to a hand. This player must be present \nat the table or have posted a blind or ante. \n2. Action is considered to occur i n stud games when two players after the forced bet \nhave acted on their hands. In button games, action is considered to occur when two \nplayers after the blinds have acted on their hands. Once action occurs, a misdeal \ncan no longer be declared. The hand will be played to conclusion and no money will \nbe returned to any player whose hand is fouled. \nDEAD HANDS \n1. Your hand is declared dead if: \n(a) You fold or announce that you are folding when facing a bet or a raise. \n \n(b) You throw your hand away in a forward motion causing another player to act \nbehind you (even if not facing a bet). \n \n(c) In stud, when facing a bet, you pick your upcards off the table, turn your upcards \nfacedown, or mix your upcards and downcards together. \n \n(d) The hand does not contain the pro per number of cards for that poker form \n(except at stud a hand missing the final card may be ruled live, and at lowball \nand draw high a hand with too few cards before the draw is live). [See Section \nGENERAL POKER RULES \n8 \n16 - \u201cExplanations,\u201d discussion #4, for more information on the stud portion of \nthis rule.] \n(e) You act on a hand with a joker as a holecard in a game not using a joker. (A \nplayer who acts on a hand without looking at a card assumes the liability of \nfinding an improper card, as given in Irregularities, rule #8.) \n(f) You have the clock on you when facing a bet or raise and exceed the specified \ntime limit. \n2. Cards thrown into the muck may be ruled dead. However, a hand that is clearly \nidentifiable may be retrieved if doing so is in the best interest of the game. A n extra \neffort should be made to rule a hand retrievable if it was folded as a result of false \ninformation given to the player. \n3. Cards thrown into another player\u2019s hand are dead, whether they are faceup or \nfacedown. \nIRREGULARITIES \n1. In button games, i f it is discovered that the button was placed incorrectly on the \nprevious hand, the button and blinds will be corrected for the new hand in a manner \nthat gives every player one chance for each position on the round (if possible). \n2. You must protect your o wn hand at all times. Your cards may be protected with \nyour hands, a chip, or other object placed on top of them. If you fail to protect your \nhand, you will have no redress if it becomes fouled or the dealer accidentally kills it. \n3. If a card with a diffe rent color back appears during a hand, all action is void and all \nchips in the pot are returned to the respective bettors. If a card with a different color \nback is discovered in the stub, all action stands. \n4. If two cards of the same rank and suit are fou nd, all action is void, and all chips in \nthe pot are returned to the players who wagered them (subject to next rule). \n5. A player who knows the deck is defective has an obligation to point this out. If such \na player instead tries to win a pot by taking agg ressive action (trying for a freeroll), \nthe player may lose the right to a refund, and the chips may be required to stay in \nthe pot for the next deal. \nGENERAL POKER RULES \n9 \n6. If there is extra money in the pot on a deal as a result of forfeited money from the \nprevious deal (as per rule #5), or some similar reason, only a player dealt in on the \nprevious deal is entitled to a hand. \n7. A card discovered faceup in the deck (boxed card) will be treated as a meaningless \nscrap of paper. A card being treated as a scrap of paper will be replaced by the \nnext card below it in the deck, except when the next card has already been dealt \nfacedown to another player and mixed in with other downcards. In that case, the \ncard that was faceup in the deck will be replaced after all other cards are dealt for \nthat round. \n8. A joker that appears in a game where it is not used is treated as a scrap of paper. \nDiscovery of a joker does not cause a misdeal. If the joker is discovered before a \nplayer acts on his or her hand, it is replaced as in the previou s rule. If the player \ndoes not call attention to the joker before acting, then the player has a dead hand. \n9. If you play a hand without looking at all of your cards, you assume the liability of \nhaving an irregular card or an improper joker. \n10. One or more cards missing from the deck does not invalidate the results of a hand. \n11. Before the first round of betting, if a dealer deals one additional card, it is returned \nto the deck and used as the burncard. \n12. Procedure for an exposed card varies with the po ker form, and is given in the \nsection for each game. A card that is flashed by a dealer is treated as an exposed \ncard. A card that is flashed by a player will play. To obtain a ruling on whether a \ncard was exposed and should be replaced, a player should an nounce that the card \nwas flashed or exposed before looking at it. A downcard dealt off the table is an \nexposed card. \n13. If a card is exposed due to dealer error, a player does not have an option to take or \nreject the card. The situation will be governed b y the rules for the particular game \nbeing played. \n14. If you drop any cards out of your hand onto the floor, you must still play them. \n15. If the dealer prematurely deals any cards before the betting is complete, those \ncards will not play, even if a player who has not acted decides to fold. \nGENERAL POKER RULES \n10 \nBETTING AND RAISING \n1. Check-raise is permitted in all games, except in certain forms of lowball. \n2. In no-limit and pot-limit games, unlimited raising is allowed. \n3. In limit poker, for a pot involving three or more pla yers who are not all -in, there is a \nmaximum of a bet and three raises allowed. \n4. Unlimited raising for money games is allowed in heads -up play. This applies any \ntime the action becomes heads -up before the raising has been capped. Once the \nraising is cappe d on a betting round, it cannot be uncapped by a subsequent fold \nthat leaves two players heads -up. For tournament play, the three raise maximum for \nlimit poker applies when heads-up as well. \n5. In limit play, an all -in wager of less than half a bet does no t reopen the betting for \nany player who has already acted and is in the pot for all previous bets. A player \nfacing less than half a bet may fold, call, or complete the wager. An all-in wager of a \nhalf a bet or more is treated as a full bet, and a player ma y fold, call, or make a full \nraise. (An example of a full raise is on a $20 betting round, raising a $15 all-in bet to \n$35). \n6. Any wager must be at least the size of the previous bet or raise in that round, \nunless a player is going all-in. \n7. The smallest chip that may be wagered in a game is the smallest chip used in the \nantes and/or blinds. Smaller chips than this do not play even in quantity, so a player \nwanting action on such chips must change them up between deals. If betting is in \ndollar units or greater, a fraction of a dollar does not play. A player going all -in must \nput all chips that play into the pot. \n8. A verbal statement denotes your action and is binding. If in turn you verbally \ndeclare a fold, check, bet, call, or raise, you are forced to take that action. \n9. Rapping the table with your hand is a pass. \n10. Deliberately acting out of turn will not be tolerated. A player who checks out of turn \nmay not bet or raise on the next turn to act. An action or verbal declaration out of \nGENERAL POKER RULES \n11 \nturn may be ruled binding if there is no bet, call, or raise by an intervening player \nacting after the infraction has been committed. \n11. To retain the right to act, a player must stop the action by calling \u201ctime\u201d (or an \nequivalent word). Failure to stop the action before t hree or more players have acted \nbehind you may cause you to lose the right to act. You cannot forfeit your right to \nact if any player in front of you has not acted, only if you fail to act when it legally \nbecomes your turn. Therefore, if you wait for someo ne whose turn comes before \nyou, and three or more players act behind you, this still does not hinder your right to \nact. \n12. A player who bets or calls by releasing chips into the pot is bound by that action. \nHowever, if you are unaware that the pot has bee n raised, you may withdraw that \nmoney and reconsider your action, provided that no one else has acted after you. \n13. In limit poker, if you make a forward motion into the pot area with chips and thus \ncause another player to act, you may be forced to complete your action. \n14. String raises are not allowed. To protect your right to raise, you should either \ndeclare your intention verbally or place the proper amount of chips into the pot. \nPutting a full bet plus a half-bet or more into the pot is considered to be the same as \nannouncing a raise, and the raise must be completed. (This does not apply in the \nuse of a single chip of greater value.) \n15. If you put a single chip in the pot that is larger than the bet, but do not announce a \nraise, you are assumed to ha ve only called. Example: In a $3 -$6 game, when a \nplayer bets $6 and the next player puts a $25 chip in the pot without saying \nanything, that player has merely called the $6 bet. \n16. All wagers and calls of an improperly low amount must be brought up to pro per size \nif the error is discovered before the betting round has been completed. This \nincludes actions such as betting a lower amount than the minimum bring -in (other \nthan going all -in) and betting the lower limit on an upper limit betting round. If a \nwager is supposed to be made in a rounded off amount, is not, and must be \ncorrected, it shall be changed to the proper amount nearest in size. No one who \nhas acted may change a call to a raise because the wager size has been changed. \nGENERAL POKER RULES \n12 \nTHE SHOWDOWN \n1. A player must show all cards in the hand face -up on the table to win any part of the \npot. \n2. Cards speak (cards read for themselves). The dealer assists in reading hands, but \nplayers are responsible for holding onto their cards until the winner is declared. \nAlthough verbal declarations as to the contents of a hand are not binding, \ndeliberately miscalling a hand with the intent of causing another player to discard a \nwinning hand is unethical and may result in forfeiture of the pot. (For more \ninformation on miscalling a hand see \u201cSection 11 - Lowball,\u201d Rule 15 and Rule 16.) \n3. Anyone who sees an incorrect amount of chips put into the pot, or an error about to \nbe made in awarding a pot, has an ethical obligation to point out the error. Please \nhelp us keep mistakes of this nature to a minimum. \n4. All losing hands will be killed by the dealer before a pot is awarded. \n5. Any player who has been dealt in may request to see any hand that has been \ncalled, even if the opponent's hand or the winning hand has been mucked. \nHowever, this is a privilege that may be revoked if abused. If a player other than the \npot winner asks to see a hand that has been folded, that hand is dead. If the \nwinning player asks to see a losing player\u2019s hand, both hands are live, and the best \nhand wins. \n6. If you show cards to another player during or after a deal, any player at the table \nhas the right to see those exposed cards. Cards shown during a deal to a player not \nin the pot should only be shown to all players when the deal is finished. \n7. If everyone checks (or is all-in) on the final betting round, the player who acted first \nis the first to show the hand. If there is wagering on the final betting round, the last \nplayer to take aggressive action by a bet or raise is the first to show the hand. In \norder to speed up the game, a player holding a probable winner is encouraged to \nshow the hand without delay. If there is a side pot, players involved in the side pot \nshould show their hands before anyone who is all-in for only the main pot. \nGENERAL POKER RULES \n13 \nTIES \n1. The ranking of suits from highest to lowest is spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs. \nSuits never break a tie for winning a pot. Suits are used to break a tie between \ncards of the same rank (no redeal or redraw). \n2. Dealing a card to each player is used to determine things like who moves to \nanother table. If the cards are dealt, the order is clockwise starting with the first \nplayer on the dealer\u2019s left (the button position is irrelevant). Drawing a card is used \nto determine things like who gets the button in a new game. \n3. An odd chip will be broken down to the smallest unit used in the game. \n4. No player may receive more than one odd chip. \n5. If two or more hands tie, an odd chip will be awarded as follows: \n(a) In a button game, the first hand clockwise from the button gets the odd chip. \n(b) In a stud game, the odd chip will be given to the highest card by suit in all high \ngames, and to the lowest card by suit in all low games. (When making this \ndetermination, all cards are used, not just the five cards that constitute the \nplayer's hand.) \n(c) In high -low split games, the high hand receives the odd chip in a split between \nthe high and the low hands. The odd chip between tied high hands is awarded as \nin a high game of that poker form, and the odd chip between tied low hands is \nawarded as in a low game of that poker form. \n(d) All side pots and the main pot will be split as separate pots, not mixed together. \n \n14 \nSECTION 4 - BUTTON AND BLIND USE \n \nIn button games, If the players deal the cards themselves, \u201cthe button\u201d refers to the \nperson who dealt the cards. (If a non -playing dealer does the actual dealing, a round \ndisk called the button is used to indicate which player has the dealer position.) The \nplayer with the button is last to receive cards on the initial deal and has the right o f last \naction after the first betting round. The button moves clockwise after a deal ends to \nrotate the advantage of last action. One or more blind bets are usually used to \nstimulate action and initiate play. Blinds are posted before the players look at th eir \ncards. Blinds are part of a player\u2019s bet, unless the structure of a game or the situation \nrequires part or all of a particular blind to be \u201cdead.\u201d Dead chips are not part of a \nplayer\u2019s bet. With two blinds, the small blind is posted by the player immed iately \nclockwise from the button, and the big blind is posted by the player two positions \nclockwise from the button. With more than two blinds, the little blind is normally left of \nthe button (not on it). Action is initiated on the first betting round by t he first player to \nthe left of the blinds. On all subsequent betting rounds, the action begins with the first \nactive player to the left of the button. \nRULES FOR USING BLINDS \n \n1. Each round every player must get an opportunity for the button, and meet the t otal \namount of the blind obligations. Either of the following methods of button and blind \nplacement may be designated to do this: \n \n(a) Moving button \u2013 The button always moves forward to the next player and the \nblinds adjust accordingly. There may be more than one big blind. \n(b) Dead button \u2013 The big blind is posted by the player due for it, and the small \nblind and button are positioned accordingly, even if this means the small blind \nor the button is placed in front of an empty seat, giving the same player t he \nprivilege of last action on consecutive hands. \n[See \u201cSection 16 \u2013 Explanations,\u201d discussion #1, for more information on this rule.] \n2. A player who posts a blind has the option of raising the pot at the first turn to act. \n(This does not apply when a \"de ad blind\" for the collection is used in a game and \nhas been posted). \n3. In heads-up play with two blinds, the small blind is on the button. \nBUTTON AND BLIND USE \n15 \n4. A new player entering the game has the following options: \n(a) Wait for the big blind. \n(b) Post an amount equal to the big blind and immediately be dealt a hand. (In \nlowball, a new player must either post an amount double the big blind or wait \nfor the big blind.) \n \n5. A new player who elects to let the button go by once without posting is not treated \nas a player in the game who has missed a blind, and needs to post only the big \nblind when entering the game. \n \n6. A person playing over is considered a new player, and must post the amount of the \nbig blind or wait for the big blind. \n \n7. A new player cannot be dealt in betwee n the big blind and the button. Blinds may \nnot be made up between the big blind and the button. You must wait until the button \npasses. [See \u201cSection 16 \u2013 Explanations,\u201d discussion #3, for more information on \nthis rule.] \n8. When you post the big blind, it serves as your opening bet. When it is your next turn \nto act, you have the option to raise. \n9. A player who misses any or all blinds can resume play by either posting all the \nblinds missed or waiting for the big blind. If you choose to post the total amount of \nthe blinds, an amount up to the size of the minimum opening bet is live. The \nremainder is taken by the dealer to the center of the pot and is not part of your bet. \nWhen it is your next turn to act, you have the option to raise. \n10. If a player who owes a blind (as a result of a missed blind) is dealt in without \nposting, the hand is dead if the player looks at it before putting up the required \nchips, and has not yet acted. If the player acts on the hand and plays it, putting \nchips into the pot before the error is discovered, the hand is live, and the player is \nrequired to post on the next deal. \n11. A player who goes all -in and loses is obligated to make up the blinds if they are \nmissed before a rebuy is made. (The person is not treated as a new player whe n \nreentering.) \nBUTTON AND BLIND USE \n16 \n12. These rules about blinds apply to a newly started game: \n(a) Any player who drew for the button is considered active in the game and is \nrequired to make up any missed blinds. \n(b) A new player will not be required to post a blind until the button has made one \ncomplete revolution around the table, provided a blind has not yet passed that \nseat. \n(c) A player may change seats without penalty, provided a blind has not yet passed \nthe new seat. \n13. In all multiple -blind games, a player who changes seats will be dealt in on the first \navailable hand in the same relative position. Example: If you move two active \npositions away from the big blind, you must wait two hands before being dealt in \nagain. If you move closer to the big blind, you can be dealt in without any penalty. If \nyou do not wish to wait and have not yet missed a blind, then you can post an \namount equal to the big blind and receive a hand. (Exception: At lowball you must \nkill the pot, wait for the same relative position, or wait for the b ig blind; see \u201cSection \n11 \u2013 Lowball,\u201d rule #7.) \n14. A player who \"deals off\" (by playing the button and then immediately getting up to \nchange seats) can allow the blinds to pass the new seat one time and reenter the \ngame behind the button without having to post a blind. \n15. A live \u201cstraddle bet\" is not allowed at limit poker except in specified games. \n \n17 \nSECTION 5 - HOLD\u2019EM \nIn hold\u2019em, players receive two downcards as their personal hand (holecards), after \nwhich there is a round of betting. Three boardcards are turned simultaneously (called \nthe \u201cflop\u201d) and another round of betting occurs. The next two boardcards are turned \none at a time, with a round of betting after each card. The boardcards are community \ncards, and a player may use any five -card combination from among the board and \npersonal cards. A player may even use all of the boardcards and no personal cards to \nform a hand (play the board). A dealer button is used. The usual structure is to use two \nblinds, but it is possible to play the game with one bli nd, multiple blinds, an ante, or \ncombination of blinds plus an ante. \nRULES \nThese rules deal only with irregularities. See the previous chapter, \u201cButton and Blind \nUse,\u201d for rules on that subject. \n1. If the first holecard dealt is exposed, a misdeal results. The dealer will retrieve the \ncard, reshuffle, and recut the cards. If any other holecard is exposed due to a \ndealer error, the deal continues. The exposed card may not be kept. After \ncompleting the hand, the dealer replaces the card with the top card on t he deck, \nand the exposed card is then used for the burncard. If more than one holecard is \nexposed, this is a misdeal and there must be a redeal. \n2. If the flop contains too many cards, it must be redealt. (This applies even if it were \npossible to know which card was the extra one.) \n3. If the flop needs to be redealt because the cards were prematurely flopped before \nthe betting was complete, or the flop contained too many cards, the boardcards are \nmixed with the remainder of the deck. The burncard remains on the table. After \nshuffling, the dealer cuts the deck and deals a new flop without burning a card. [See \n\u201cSection 16 \u2013 Explanations,\u201d discussion #2, for more information on this rule.] \n4. If the dealer turns the fourth card on the board before the betting r ound is complete, \nthe card is taken out of play for that round, even if subsequent players elect to fold. \nThe betting is then completed. The dealer burns and turns what would have been \nthe fifth card in the fourth card\u2019s place. After this round of betting, the dealer \nreshuffles the deck, including the card that was taken out of play, but not including \nHOLD\u2019EM \n18 \nthe burncards or discards. The dealer then cuts the deck and turns the final card \nwithout burning a card. If the fifth card is turned up prematurely, the deck is \nreshuffled and dealt in the same manner. [See \u201cSection 16 \u2013 Explanations,\u201d \ndiscussion #2, for more information on this rule.] \n5. If the dealer mistakenly deals the first player an extra card (after all players have \nreceived their starting hands), the card will be returned to the deck and used for the \nburncard. If the dealer mistakenly deals more than one extra card, it is a misdeal. \n6. You must declare that you are playing the board before you throw your cards away; \notherwise you relinquish all claim to the pot. \n \n19 \nSECTION 6 - OMAHA \nOmaha is similar to hold\u2019em in using a three -card flop on the board, a fourth boardcard, \nand then a fifth boardcard. Each player is dealt four holecards (instead of two) at the \nstart. In order to make a hand, a player must use precisely two holecards with three \nboardcards. The betting is the same as in hold'em. At the showdown, the entire four -\ncard hand should be shown to receive the pot. \nRULES OF OMAHA \n1. All the rules of hold\u2019em apply to Omaha except the rule on playing the bo ard, which \nis not possible in Omaha (because you must use two cards from your hand and \nthree cards from the board). \n \n20 \nSECTION 7 - OMAHA HIGH-LOW \nOmaha is often played high -low split, 8-or-better. The player may use any combination \nof two holecards and three boardcards for the high hand and another (or the same) \ncombination of two holecards and three boardcards for the low hand. \nThe rules governing kill pots are listed in \u201cSection 13 \u2013 Kill Pots.\u201d \nRULES OF OMAHA HIGH-LOW \n1. All the rules of Omaha apply to Omaha high-low split except as below. \n2. A qualifier of 8-or-better for low applies to all high -low split games, unless a specific \nposting to the contrary is displayed. If there is no qualifying hand for low, the best \nhigh hand wins the whole pot. \n \n21 \nSECTION 8 - SEVEN-CARD STUD \nSeven-card stud is played with two downcards and one upcard dealt before the first \nbetting round, followed by three more upcards (with a betting round after each card). \nAfter the last downcard is dealt, there is a final round of betting. The best five -card \npoker hand wins the pot. In all fixed -limit games, the smaller bet is wagered on the first \ntwo betting rounds, and the larger bet is wagered after the betting rounds on the fifth, \nsixth, and seventh cards. If there is an open pair on th e fourth card, any player has the \noption of making the smaller or larger bet. Deliberately changing the order of your \nupcards in a stud game is improper because it unfairly misleads the other players. \nRULES OF SEVEN-CARD STUD \n \n1. The first round of betting starts with a forced bet by the lowest upcard by suit. On \nsubsequent betting rounds, the high hand on board initiates the action (a tie is \nbroken by position, with the player who received cards first acting first). \n2. The player with the forced bet has the option of opening for a full bet. \n3. Increasing the amount wagered by the opening forced bet up to a full bet does not \ncount as a raise, but merely as a completion of the bet. For example: In $15 -$30 \nstud, the lowcard opens for $5. If the next player inc reases the bet to $15 \n(completes the bet), up to three raises are then allowed when using a three -raise \nlimit. \n4. In all fixed -limit games, when an open pair is showing on fourth street (second \nupcard), any player has the option of betting either the lower or the upper limit. For \nexample: In a $5 -$10 game, if you have a pair showing and are the high hand, you \nmay bet either $5 or $10. If you bet $5, any player then has the option to call $5, \nraise $5, or raise $10. If a $10 raise is made, then all other rai ses must be in \nincrements of $10. If the player high with the open pair on fourth street checks, then \nsubsequent players have the same options that were given to the player who was \nhigh. \n5. If your first or second holecard is accidentally turned up by the dealer, then your \nthird card will be dealt down. If both holecards are dealt up, you have a dead hand \nand receive your ante back. If the first card dealt faceup would have been the \nlowcard, action starts with the first hand to that player\u2019s left. That play er may fold, \nSEVEN-CARD STUD \n22 \nopen for the forced bet, or open for a full bet. (In tournament play, if a downcard is \ndealt faceup, a misdeal is called.) \n6. If you are not present at the table when it is your turn to act on your hand, you \nforfeit your ante and your forced b et, if any. If you have not returned to the table in \ntime to act, the hand will be killed when the betting reaches your seat. \n7. If a hand is folded when there is no wager, that seat will continue to receive cards \nuntil the hand is killed as a result of a bet. \n8. If you are all in for the ante and have the lowcard, the player to your left acts first. \nThat player may fold, open for the forced bet, or open for a full bet. \n9. If the wrong person is designated as low and that person bets, the action will be \ncorrected to the true lowcard if the next player has not yet acted. The incorrect \nlowcard takes back the wager and the true lowcard must bet. If the next hand has \nacted after the incorrect lowcard wager, the wager stands, action continues from \nthere, and the true lowcard has no obligations. \n10. If you pick up your upcards without calling when facing a wager, this is a fold and \nyour hand is dead. This act has no significance at the showdown because betting is \nover; the hand is live until discarded. \n11. A card dealt off the table must play and it is treated as an exposed card. \n12. Dealers should not announce possible straights or flushes. \n13. If the dealer burns two cards for one round or fails to burn a card, the cards will be \ncorrected, if at all possible, to t heir proper positions. If this should happen on a final \ndowncard, and either a card intermingles with a player's other holecards or a player \nlooks at the card, the player must accept that card. \n14. If the dealer burns and deals one or more cards before a r ound of betting has been \ncompleted, the card(s) must be eliminated from play. After the betting for that round \nis completed, an additional card for each remaining player still active in the hand is \nalso eliminated from play (to later deal the same cards to the players who would \nhave received them without the error). After that round of betting has concluded, the \ndealer burns a card and play resumes. The removed cards are held off to the side \nin the event the dealer runs out of cards. If the prematurely deal t card is the final \nSEVEN-CARD STUD \n23 \ndowncard and has been looked at or intermingled with the player's other holecards, \nthe player must keep the card, and on sixth street betting may not bet or raise \n(because the player now has all seven cards). \n15. If there are not enough cards left in the deck for all players, all the cards are dealt \nexcept the last card, which is mixed with the burncards (and any cards removed \nfrom the deck, as in the previous rule). The dealer then scrambles and cuts these \ncards, burns again, and delive rs the remaining downcards, using the last card if \nnecessary. If there are not as many cards as players remaining without a card, the \ndealer does not burn, so that each player can receive a fresh card. If the dealer \ndetermines that there will not be enough fresh cards for all of the remaining players, \nthen the dealer announces to the table that a common card will be used. The dealer \nwill burn a card and turn one card faceup in the center of the table as a common \ncard that plays in everyone\u2019s hand. The playe r who is now high using the common \ncard initiates the action for the last round. \n16. An all-in player should receive holecards dealt facedown, but if the final holecard to \nsuch a player is dealt faceup, the card must be kept, and the other players receive \ntheir normal card. \n17. If the dealer turns the last card faceup to any player, the hand now high on the \nboard using all the upcards will start the action. The following rules apply to the \ndealing of cards: \n(a) If there are more than two players, all remain ing players receive their last card \nfacedown. A player whose last card is faceup has the option of declaring all -in \n(before betting action starts). \n(b) If there are only two players remaining and the first player's final downcard is \ndealt faceup, the secon d player's final downcard will also be dealt faceup, and \nthe betting proceeds as normal. In the event the first player's final card is dealt \nfacedown and the opponent's final card is dealt faceup, the player with the \nfaceup final card has the option of declaring all-in (before betting action starts). \n18. A hand with more than seven cards is dead. A hand with less than seven cards at \nthe showdown is dead, except any player missing a seventh card may have the \nhand ruled live. [See \u201cSection 16 \u2013 Explanations,\u201d discussion #4, for more \ninformation on this rule.] \nSEVEN-CARD STUD \n24 \n19. A player who calls a bet even though beaten by an opponent\u2019s upcards is not \nentitled to a refund. (The player is receiving information about an opponent\u2019s hand \nthat is not available for free.) \n \n25 \nSECTION 9 - RAZZ (SEVEN-CARD STUD LOW) \nThe lowest hand wins the pot. The format is similar to seven -card stud high, except the \nhigh card (aces are low) is required to make the forced bet on the first round, and the \nlow hand acts first on all subsequent rounds. Straights and flushes have no ranking, so \nthe best possible hand is 5 -4-3-2-A (a wheel). An open pair does not affect the betting \nlimit. \nRULES OF RAZZ \n \n1. All seven-card stud rules apply in razz except as otherwise noted. \n2. The lowest hand wins the pot. A ces are low, and straights and flushes have no \neffect on the low value of a hand. The best possible hand is 5-4-3-2-A. \n3. The highest card by suit starts the action with a forced bet. The low hand acts first \non all subsequent rounds. If the low hand is tie d, the first player clockwise from the \ndealer starts the action. \n4. Fixed-limit games use the lower limit on third and fourth streets and the upper limit \non subsequent streets. An open pair does not affect the limit.\n \n26 \nSECTION 10 - SEVEN-CARD STUD HIGH-LOW \n \nSeven-card stud high -low split is a stud game which is played both high and low. A \nqualifier of 8 -or-better for low applies to all high -low split games, unless a specific \nposting to the contrary is displayed. The low card initiates the action on the first round, \nwith an ace counting as a high card for this purpose. On subsequent rounds, the high \nhand initiates the action. If the high hand is tied, the first player clockwise from the \ndealer acts first. Fixed -limit games use the lower limit on third and fourt h street and the \nupper limit on subsequent betting rounds, and an open pair does not affect the limit. \nAces may be used for high or low. Straights and flushes do not affect the low value of a \nhand. A player may use any five cards to make the best high hand, and the same or any \nother grouping of five cards to make the best low hand. \n \nRULES OF SEVEN-CARD STUD HIGH-LOW \n \n1. All rules for seven -card stud apply to seven -card stud high -low split, except as \notherwise noted. \n2. A qualifier of 8-or-better for low applies to all high-low split games, unless a specific \nposting to the contrary is displayed. If there is no qualifying hand for low, the best \nhigh hand wins the whole pot. \n3. A player may use any five cards to make the best high hand and any five cards, \nwhether the same as the high hand or not, to make the best low hand. \n4. The low card by suit initiates the action on the first round, with an ace counting as a \nhigh card for this purpose. \n5. An ace may be used for high or low. \n6. Straights and flushes do not affect the value of a low hand. \n7. Fixed-limit games use the lower limit on third and fourth streets and the upper limit \non subsequent rounds. An open pair on fourth street does not affect the limit. \n8. Splitting pots is only determined by the cards and not by agreement among players. \nSEVEN-CARD STUD HIGH-LOW \n27 \n9. When there is an odd chip in a pot, the chip goes to the high hand. If two players \nsplit the pot by tying for both the high and the low, the pot shall be split as evenly as \npossible, and the player with the highest card by suit receives the odd chip. When \nmaking this determination, all cards are used, not just the five cards used for the \nfinal hand played. \n10. When there is one odd chip in the high portion of the pot and two or more high \nhands split all or half the pot, the odd chip goes to the player with the high card by \nsuit. When two or more low hands split half the pot, the odd chip goes to the player \nwith the low card by suit. \n \n28 \nSECTION 11 - LOWBALL \nLowball is draw poker with the lowest hand winning the pot. Each player is dealt five \ncards facedown, after which there is a betting round. Players are required to open with a \nbet or fold. The players who remain in the pot after the first betting round now have an \noption to improve their hand by replacing cards in their hands with new ones. This is the \ndraw. The game is normally played with one or more blinds, sometimes with an ante \nadded. Some betting structures allow the big blind to be called; other structures require \nthe minimum open to be double the big blind. In limit pok er, the usual structure has the \nlimit double after the draw (Northern California is an exception). The most popular forms \nof lowball are ace-to-five lowball (also known as California lowball), and deuce -to-seven \nlowball (also known as Kansas City lowball). Ace-to-five lowball gets its name because \nthe best hand at that form is 5 -4-3-2-A. Deuce-to-seven lowball gets its name because \nthe best hand at that form is 7-5-4-3-2 (not of the same suit). For a further description of \nthe forms of lowball, please see t he individual section for each game. All rules \ngoverning kill pots are listed in \u201cSection 13 \u2013 Kill Pots.\u201d \nRULES OF LOWBALL \n \n1. The rules governing misdeals for hold\u2019em and other button games will be used for \nlowball. [See \u201cSection 16 \u2013 Explanations,\u201d discussion #7, for more information on \nthis rule.] These rules governing misdeals are reprinted here for convenience. \n \u201cThe following circumstances cause a misdeal, provided attention is called to the \nerror before two players have acted on their hands: \n(a) The first or second card of the hand has been dealt faceup or exposed through \ndealer error. \n (b) Two or more cards have been exposed by the dealer. \n (c) Two or more extra cards have been dealt in the starting hands of a game. \n (d) An incorrect number of cards has been dealt to a player, except the button may \nreceive one more card to complete a starting hand. \n (e) The button was out of position. \n (f) The first card was dealt to the wrong position. \n (g) Cards have been dealt out of the proper sequence. \n(h) Cards have been dealt to an empty seat or a player not entitled to a hand. \nLOWBALL \n29 \n (i) A player has been dealt out who is entitled to a hand. This player must be \npresent at the table or have posted a blind or ante.\u201d \n2. As a new player, you have two options: \n(a) To wait for the big blind. \n(b) To kill the pot for double the amount of the big blind. \n3. In a single-blind game, a player who has less than half a blind may receive a hand. \nHowever, the next player is obligated to take the blind. If the all -in player wins the \npot or buys in again, that player will then be obligated to either take the blind on the \nnext deal or sit out until due for the big blind. \n4. In single-blind games, half a blind or more constitutes a full blind. \n5. In single-blind games, if you fa il to take the blind, you may only be dealt in on the \nblind. \n6. In multiple-blind games, if for any reason the big blind passes your seat, you may \neither wait for the big blind or kill the pot in order to receive a hand. This does not \napply if you have tak en all of your blinds and changed seats. In this situation, you \nmay be dealt in as soon as your position relative to the blinds entitles you to a hand \n(the button may go by you once without penalty). \n7. Before the draw, whether an exposed card must be take n depends on the form of \nlowball being played; see that form. (The player never has an option.) \n8. On the draw, an exposed card cannot be taken. The draw is completed to each \nplayer in order, and then the exposed card is replaced. \n9. A player may draw up to four consecutive cards. If a player wishes to draw five new \ncards, four are dealt right away, and the fifth card after everyone else has drawn \ncards. If the last player wishes to draw five new cards, four are dealt right away, \nand a card is burned before the player receives a fifth card. [See \u201cSection 16 \u2013 \nExplanations,\u201d discussion #9, for more information about this rule.] \n10. Five cards constitute a playing hand; more or fewer than five cards after the draw \nconstitutes a fouled hand. Before the draw, if you have fewer than five cards in your \nhand, you may receive additional cards, provided no action has been taken by the \nLOWBALL \n30 \nfirst player to act (unless that action occurs before the deal is completed). However, \nthe dealer position may still receive a missing fifth card, even if action has taken \nplace. If action has been taken, you are entitled on the draw to receive the number \nof cards necessary to complete a five-card hand. \n11. You may change the number of cards you wish to draw, provided: \n(a) No card has bee n dealt off the deck in response to your request (including the \nburncard). \n(b) No player has acted, in either the betting or indicating the number of cards to be \ndrawn, based on the number of cards you have requested. \n12. If you are asked how many cards yo u drew by another active player, you are \nobligated to respond until there has been action after the draw, and the dealer is \nalso obligated to respond. Once there is any action after the draw, you are no \nlonger obliged to respond and the dealer cannot respond. \n13. Rapping the table in turn constitutes either a pass or the declaration of a pat hand \nthat does not want to draw any cards, depending on the situation. \n14. Cards speak (cards read for themselves). However, you are not allowed to claim a \nbetter hand than you hold. (Example: If a player calls an \"8\", that player must \nproduce at least an \"8\" low or better to win. But if a player erroneously calls the \nsecond card incorrectly, such as \u201c8 -6\u201d when actually holding an 8 -7, no penalty \napplies.) If you miscall your hand and cause another player to foul his or her hand, \nyour hand is dead. If both hands remain intact, the best hand wins. If a miscalled \nhand occurs in a multihanded pot, the miscalled hand is dead, and the best \nremaining hand wins the pot. For your own protection, always hold your hand until \nyou see your opponent\u2019s cards. \n16. Any player spreading a hand with a pair in it must announce \"pair\" or risk losing the \npot if it causes any other player to foul a hand. If two or more hands remain intact, \nthe best hand wins the pot. \nACE-TO-FIVE LOWBALL \nIn ace-to-five lowball, the best hand is any 5-4-3-2-A. Straights and flushes do not count \nagainst your hand. \nLOWBALL \n31 \n1. If a joker is used, it becomes the lowest card not present in your hand. The joker is \nassumed to be in use unless the contrary is posted. \n2. In limit play, check -raise is not permitted (unless the players are alerted that it is \nallowed). \n3. In limit ace -to-five lowball, before the draw, an exposed card of seven or under \nmust be taken, and an exposed car d higher than a seven must be replaced after \nthe deal has been completed. This first exposed card is used as the burncard. [See \n\u201cSection 16 \u2013 Explanations,\u201d discussion #8, for more information on this rule.] \n4. Some lowball games may wish to employ the \u201cse vens rule.\u201d It works as follows. If \nyou check a seven or better and it is the best hand, all action after the draw is void, \nand you cannot win any money on any subsequent bets. You are still eligible to win \nwhatever existed in the pot before the draw if yo u have the best hand. If you check \na seven or better and the hand is beaten, you lose the pot and any additional calls \nyou make. If there is an all-in bet after the draw that is less than half a bet, a seven \nor better may just call and win that bet. Howeve r, if another player overcalls this \nshort bet and loses, the person who overcalls receives the bet back. If the seven or \nbetter completes to a full bet, this fulfills all obligations. \nDEUCE-TO-SEVEN LOWBALL \n \nIn deuce-to-seven lowball (sometimes known as Ka nsas City lowball), in most respects, \nthe worst conventional poker hand wins. Straights and flushes count against you, \ncrippling the value of a hand. The ace is used only as a high card. Therefore, the best \nhand is 7-5-4-3-2, not all of the same suit. The hand 5-4-3-2-A is not considered to be a \nstraight, but an ace-5 high, so it beats other ace-high hands and pairs, but loses to king-\nhigh. A pair of aces is the highest pair, so it loses to any other pair. \nThe rules for deuce-to-seven lowball are the same as those for ace-to-five lowball, \nexcept for the following differences: \n \n1. The best hand is 7-5-4-3-2 of at least two different suits. Straights and flushes count \nagainst you, and aces are considered high only. \n2. Before the draw, an exposed card of 7, 5 , 4, 3, or, 2 must be taken. Any other \nexposed card must be replaced (including a 6). \nLOWBALL \n32 \n3. Check-raise is allowed on any hand after the draw, and a seven or better is not \nrequired to bet. \nNO-LIMIT AND POT-LIMIT LOWBALL \n1. All the rules for no -limit and pot-limit poker (see Section 14 - No-limit and Pot-limit) \napply to no-limit and pot-limit lowball. All other lowball rules apply, except as noted. \n2. A player is not entitled to know that an opponent does not hold the best possible \nhand, so these rules for exposed cards before the draw apply: \n(a) In ace-to-five lowball, a player must take an exposed card of A, 2, 3, 4, or 5, and \nany other card must be replaced. \n(b) In deuce-to-seven lowball, the player must take an exposed card of 2, 3, 4, 5, or \n7, and any other card including a 6 must be replaced. \n3. After the draw, any exposed card must be replaced. \n4. After the draw, a player may check any hand without penalty (The sevens rule is \nnot used). \n5. Check-raise is allowed. \n \n33 \nSECTION 12 - DRAW HIGH \nThere are two betting rounds, one before the draw and one after the draw. The game is \nplayed with a button and an ante. Players in turn may check, open for the minimum, or \nopen with a raise. After the first betting round the players have the opportunity to draw \nnew cards to replace the ones they discard. Action after the draw starts with the opener, \nor next player proceeding clockwise if the opener has folded. The betting limit after the \ndraw is twice the amount of the betting limit before the draw. Some draw high games \nallow a player to open on anything; others require the opener to have a pair of jacks or \nbetter. \nRULES OF DRAW HIGH \n1. A maximum of a bet and four raises is permitted in multihanded pots. [See \u201cSection \n16 \u2013 Explanations,\u201d discussion #6, for more information on this rule.] \n2. Check-raise is permitted both before and after the draw. \n3. Any card that is exposed by the dealer before the draw must be kept. \n4. Five cards constitute a playing hand. Less than five cards for a player (other than \nthe button) before action has been taken is a misdeal. If action has been taken, a \nplayer with fewer than five cards may draw the number of cards necessary to \ncomplete a five-card hand. The button may receive the fifth card even if action has \ntaken place. More or fewer than five cards after the draw constitutes a fouled hand. \n5. A player may draw up to four consecutive cards. If a player wishes to draw five new \ncards, four are dealt right away, and the fifth card after everyone else has drawn \ncards. If the last player wishes to draw fi ve new cards, four are dealt right away, \nand a card is burned before the player receives a fifth card. [See \u201cSection 16 \u2013 \nExplanations,\u201d discussion #9, for more information about this rule.] \n6. You may change the number of cards you wish to draw, provided: \n(a) No cards have been dealt off the deck in response to your request (including the \nburncard). \n(b) No player has acted, in either the betting or indicating the number of cards to be \ndrawn, based on the number of cards you have requested. \nDRAW HIGH \n34 \n7. If you are as ked how many cards you drew by another active player, you are \nobligated to respond until there has been action after the draw, and the dealer is \nalso obligated to respond. Once there is any action after the draw, you are no \nlonger obliged to respond and the dealer cannot respond. \n8. On the draw, an exposed card cannot be taken. The draw is completed to each \nplayer in order, and then the exposed card is replaced. \n9. Rapping the table in turn constitutes either a pass or the declaration of a pat hand \nthat doe s not want to draw any cards, depending on the situation. A player who \nindicates a pat hand by rapping the table, not knowing the pot has been raised, may \nstill play his or her hand. \n10. You may not change your seat between hands when there are multiple an tes or \nforfeited money in the pot. \n11. You have the right to pay the ante (whether single or multiple) at any time and \nreceive a hand, unless there is any additional money in the pot that has been \nforfeited during a hand in which you were not involved. \n12. If the pot has been declared open by an all -in player playing for just the antes, all \ncallers must come in for the full opening bet. \n13. If you have only a full ante and no other chips on the table, you may play for just the \nantes. If no one opens and the re is another ante, you may still play for that part of \nthe antes that you have matched, without putting in any more money. \nJACKS-OR-BETTER \n \n1. A pair of jacks or better is required to open the pot. If no player opens the pot, the \nbutton moves forward and each player must ante again, unless the limit of antes \nhas been reached for that particular game. (Most games allow three consecutive \ndeals before anteing stops.) \n2. If the opener should show false openers before the draw, any other active player \nhas the o pportunity to declare the pot opened. However, any player who originally \npassed openers is not eligible to declare the pot open. The false opener has a dead \nhand and the opening bet stays in the pot. Any other bet placed in the pot by the \nDRAW HIGH \n35 \nopener may be wit hdrawn, provided the action before the draw is not completed. If \nno other player declares the pot open, all bets are returned except the opener\u2019s first \nbet. The first bet and antes will remain in the pot, and all players who were involved \nin that hand are entitled to play the next hand after anteing again. \n3. Any player who has legally declared the pot opened must prove openers in order to \nwin the pot. \n4. In all cases, the pot will play (even if the opener shows or declares a fouled hand) if \nthere has been a raise, two or more players call the opening bet, or all action is \ncompleted before the draw. \n5. Even if you are all in for just the ante (or part of the ante), you may declare the pot \nopen if you have openers. If you are all in and falsely declare the po t open, you will \nlose the ante money and may not continue to play on any subsequent deals until a \nwinner is determined. Even if you buy in again, you must wait until the pot has been \nlegally opened and someone else has won it before you can resume playing. \n6. Once action has been completed before the draw, the opener may not withdraw \nany bets, whether or not the hand contains openers. \n7. An opener may be allowed to retrieve a discarded hand to prove openers, at \nmanagement\u2019s discretion. \n8. Any player may req uest that the opener retain the opening hand and show it after \nthe winner of the pot has been determined. \n9. You may split openers, but you must declare that you are splitting and place all \ndiscards under a chip to be exposed by the dealer after the comple tion of the hand. \nIf you declare that you are splitting openers, but it is determined that you could not \npossibly have had openers when your final hand is compared with your discards, \nyou will lose the pot. \n10. You are not splitting openers if you retain o peners. If you begin with the ace, joker, \nking, queen of spades, and the ten of clubs, you are not splitting if you throw the ten \nof clubs away. You are breaking a straight to draw to a royal flush, and in doing so, \nyou have retained openers (ace-joker for two aces). \nDRAW HIGH \n36 \n11. After the draw, if you call the opener\u2019s bet and cannot beat openers, you will not get \nyour bet back. (You have received information about opener\u2019s hand that is not free.) \nTHE JOKER \n1. The players will be alerted as to whether the joker is in use. \n2. The joker may be used only as an ace, or to complete a straight, flush, or straight \nflush. (Thus it is not a completely wild card.) \n3. If the joker is used to make a flush, it will be the highest card of the flush not \npresent in the hand. \n4. Five aces is the best possible hand (four aces and joker). \n \n37 \nSECTION 13 - KILL POTS \nTo kill a pot means to post an overblind that increases the betting limit. A full kill is \ndouble the amount of the big blind, and doubles the betting limits. A half kill is on e-and-\na-half times the big blind, and increases the betting limits by that amount. A kill may be \noptional in a game, and is often used at lowball when a player wants to be dealt in right \naway instead of waiting to take the big blind. A kill may be required in a game for any \ntime a specified event takes place. In high-low split games using a required kill, a player \nwho scoops a pot bigger than a set size must kill the next pot. In other games using a \nrequired kill, a player who wins two consecutive pots must kill the next pot. In this type \nof kill game, a marker called a \u201ckill button\u201d indicates which player has won the pot, and \nthe winner keeps this marker until the next hand is completed. If the player who has the \nkill button wins a second consecutive pot an d it qualifies monetarily, that player must kill \nthe next pot. \nRULES OF KILL POTS \n1. The kill button is neutral (belonging to no player) if: \n(a) It is the first hand of a new game. \n(b) The winner of the previous pot has quit the game. \n(c) The previous pot was split and neither player had the kill button. \n2. In a kill pot, the killer acts in proper turn (after the person on the immediate right). \n3. There is no pot -size requirement for the first pot or \"leg\" of a kill. For the second \n\"leg\" to qualify for a kill, you must win at least one full bet for whatever limit you are \nplaying, and it cannot be any part of the blind structure. \n4. If a player with one \"leg up\" splits the next pot, that player still has a \"leg up\" for the \nnext hand. If the player who spli t the pot was the kill in the previous hand, then that \nplayer must also kill the next pot. \n5. A person who leaves the table with a \u201cleg up\u201d toward a kill still has a \u201cleg up\u201d upon \nreturning to the game. \n6. A player who is required to post a kill must do so that same hand even if wishing to \nquit or be dealt out. A player who fails to post a required kill blind will not be allowed \nto participate in any game until the kill money is posted. \nKILL POTS \n38 \n7. Kill blinds are considered part of the pot. If a player with a requi red kill wins again, \nthen that player must kill it again (for the same amount as the previous hand). \n8. When a player wins both the high and the low pot (\u201cscoops\u201d) in a split -pot game \nwith a kill provision, the next hand will be killed only if the pot is a t least five times \nthe size of the upper limit of the game. \n9. If you are unaware that the pot has been killed and put in a lesser amount, If it is a \nrequired kill pot with the kill button faceup, you must put in the correct amount. If \nnot, you may withdraw the chips and reconsider your action. \n10. In lowball, an optional rule is allowing players to look at their first two cards and \nthen opt whether to kill the pot. The pot may no longer be killed if any player in the \ngame has received a third card. In ord er to kill the pot voluntarily, you must have at \nleast four times the amount of the kill blind in your stack. For example: If the big \nblind is two chips, and the kill blind is four chips, the voluntary killer must have at \nleast 16 chips prior to posting th e kill. If this rule is used, it is in conjunction with \nhaving the killer act last on the first betting round rather than in proper order. \n11. Only one kill is allowed per deal. \n12. A new player is not entitled to play in a killed pot, but may do so by agr eeing to kill \nthe next pot. \n13. Broken game status is allowed only for players of the same limit and game type. \nFor this purpose, a game with a required kill is considered a different type of game \nthan an otherwise similar game without a required kill. \n \n39 \nSECTION 14 - NO LIMIT AND POT-LIMIT \nA no-limit or pot-limit betting structure for a game gives it a different character from limit \npoker, requiring a separate set of rules in many situations. All the rules for limit games \napply to no -limit and pot -limit game s, except as noted in this section. No -limit means \nthat the amount of a wager is limited only by the table stakes rule, so any part or all of a \nplayer\u2019s chips may be wagered. The rules of no -limit play also apply to pot -limit play, \nexcept that a bet may not exceed the pot size. For those rules that apply only to no -limit \nand pot-limit lowball, see the sub-section at the end of \u201cSection 11 \u2013 Lowball.\u201d \nNO-LIMIT RULES \n \n1. The number of raises in any betting round is not limited. \n2. All bets must be at least eq ual to the minimum bring -in, unless the player is going \nall-in. (A straddle bet sets a new minimum bring-in, and is not treated as a raise.) \n3. All raises must be equal to or greater than the size of the previous bet or raise on \nthat betting round, except for an all-in wager. A player who has already checked or \ncalled may not subsequently raise an all -in bet that is less than the full size of the \nlast bet or raise. (The half -the-size rule for reopening the betting is for limit poker \nonly.) \nExample: Player A bets $100 and Player B raises $100 more, making the total bet \n$200. If Player C goes all in for less than $300 total (not a full $100 raise), and \nPlayer A calls, then Player B has no option to raise again, because he wasn\u2019t fully \nraised. (Player A could have raised, because Player B raised.) \n4. A wager is not binding until the chips are actually released into the pot, unless the \nplayer has made a verbal statement of action. \n5. If there is a discrepancy between a player's verbal statement and the amount pu t \ninto the pot, the bet will be corrected to the verbal statement. \n6. If a call is short due to a counting error, the amount must be corrected, even if the \nbettor has shown down a superior hand. \n7. Because the amount of a wager at big -bet poker has such a wide range, a player \nwho has taken action based on a gross misunderstanding of the amount wagered \nNO-LIMIT AND POT-LIMIT \n40 \nneeds some protection. A bettor should not show down a hand until the amount put \ninto the pot for a call seems reasonably correct, or it is obvious that the c aller \nunderstands the amount wagered. The decision -maker is allowed considerable \ndiscretion in ruling on this type of situation. A possible rule -of-thumb is to disallow \nany claim of not understanding the amount wagered if the caller has put eighty \npercent or more of that amount into the pot. \nExample: On the end, a player puts a $500 chip into the pot and says softly, \u201cFour \nhundred.\u201d The opponent puts a $100 chip into the pot and says, \u201cCall.\u201d The bettor \nimmediately shows the hand. The dealer says, \u201cHe bet f our hundred.\u201d The caller \nsays, \u201cOh, I thought he bet a hundred.\u201d In this case, the recommended ruling \nnormally is that the bettor had an obligation to not show the hand when the amount \nput into the pot was obviously short, and the \u201ccall\u201d can be retracted. Note that the \ncharacter of each player can be a factor. (Unfortunately, situations can arise at big -\nbet poker that are not so clear-cut as this.) \n8. A player who says \"raise\" is allowed to continue putting chips into the pot with more \nthan one move; the wa ger is assumed complete when the player\u2019s hands come to \nrest outside the pot area. (This rule is used because no -limit play may require a \nlarge number of chips be put into the pot.) \n9. A bet of a single chip or bill without comment is considered to be the full amount of \nthe chip or bill allowed. However, a player acting on a previous bet with a larger \ndenomination chip or bill is calling the previous bet unless this player makes a \nverbal declaration to raise the pot. (This includes acting on the forced bet of the big \nblind.) \n10. If a player tries to bet or raise less than the legal minimum and has more chips, the \nwager must be increased to the proper size. (This does not apply to a player who \nhas unintentionally put too much in to call.) The wager is brought up to the sufficient \namount only, no greater size. \n11. All wagers may be required to be in the same denomination of chip (or larger) used \nfor the minimum bring-in, even if smaller chips are used in the blind structure. If this \nis done, the smaller chips do not play except in quantity, even when going all-in. \n12. In non -tournament games, one optional live straddle is allowed. The player who \nposts the straddle has last action for the first round of betting and is allowed to \nNO-LIMIT AND POT-LIMIT \n41 \nraise. To straddle, a player must be on the immediate left of the big blind, and must \npost an amount twice the size of the big blind. \n13. In all no-limit and pot-limit games, the house has the right to place a maximum time \nlimit for taking action on your hand. The clock may be put on some one by the \ndealer as directed by a floorperson, if a player requests it. If the clock is put on you \nwhen you are facing a bet, you will have one additional minute to act on your hand. \nYou will have a ten -second warning, after which your hand is dead if you have not \nacted. \n14. \"Insurance\" or any other \u201cproposition wagers\u201d are not allowed. Players are asked to \nrefrain from instigating proposition wagers in any form. The players are allowed to \nagree to deal twice (or three times) when someone is all -in. \u201cDealing twice\u201d means \nthe pot is divided in two, with each portion being dealt for separately. \nPOT-LIMIT RULES \n1. If a wager is made that exceeds the pot size, the surplus will be given back to the \nbettor as soon as possible, and the amount will be reduced to th e maximum \nallowable. \n2. The dealer or any player in the game can and should call attention to a wager that \nappears to exceed the pot size (this also applies to heads -up pots). The oversize \nwager may be corrected at any point until all players have acted on it. \n3. If an oversize wager has stood for a length of time with someone considering what \naction to take, that person has had to act on a wager that was thought to be a \ncertain size. If the player then decides to call or raise, and attention is called at t his \nlate point to whether this is an allowable amount, the floorperson may rule that the \noversize amount must stand (especially if the person now trying to reduce the \namount is the person that made the wager). \n4. The maximum amount a player can raise is t he amount in the pot after the call is \nmade. Therefore, if a pot is $100, and someone makes a $50 bet, the next player \ncan call $50 and raise the pot $200, for a total wager of $250. \n5. In pot-limit play, it is advisable in many structures to round off th e pot size upward \nto produce a faster pace of play. This is done by treating any odd amount as the \nNO-LIMIT AND POT-LIMIT \n42 \nnext larger size. For example, if the pot size was being kept track of with $25 units, \nthen a pot size of $80 would be treated as a pot size of $100. \n6. In pot-limit hold\u2019em and pot-limit Omaha, many structures treat the little blind as if it \nwere the same size of the big blind in computing pot size. In such a structure, a \nplayer can open for a maximum of four times the size of the big blind. For example, \nif the blinds are $5 and $10, a player may open with a raise to $40. (The range of \noptions is to either open with a call of $10, or raise in increments of five dollars to \nany amount from $20 to $40.) Subsequent players also treat the $5 as if it were $10 \nin c omputing the pot size, until the big blind is through acting on the first betting \nround. \n7. In pot -limit, if a chip or a bill larger than the pot size is put into the pot without \ncomment, it is considered to be a bet of the pot size. \n \n43 \nSECTION 15 - TOURNAMENTS \nBy participating in any tournament, you agree to abide by the rules and behave in a \ncourteous manner. A violator may be verbally warned, suspended from play for a \nspecified length of time, or disqualified from the tournament. Chips from a disqualified \nparticipant will be removed from play. \n1. Whenever possible, all rules are the same as those that apply to live games. \n2. Initial seating is determined by random draw or assignm ent. (For a one-table event, \ncards to determine seating may be left faceup so t he earlier entrants can pick their \nseat, since the button is assigned randomly.) \n3. The appropriate starting amount of chips will be placed on the table for each paid \nentrant at the beginning of the event, whether the person is present or not. Absent \nplayers will be dealt in, and all chips necessary for antes and blinds will be put into \nthe pot. \n4. If a paid entrant is absent at the start of an event, at some point an effort will be \nmade to locate and contact the player. If the player requests the chips be left in \nplace until arrival, the request will be honored. If the player is unable to be \ncontacted, the chips may be removed from play at the discretion of the director \nanytime after a new betting level is begun or a half -hour has elapsed, whichever \noccurs first. \n5. A starting stack of chips may be placed in a seat to accommodate late entrants (so \nall antes and blinds have been appropriately paid). An unsold seat will have such a \nstack removed at a time left to the discretion of the director. \n6. Limits and blinds are raised at regularly scheduled intervals. \n7. If there is a signal designating the end of a betting level, the new limits apply on the \nnext deal. (A deal begins with the first riffle of the shuffle.) \n8. The lowest denomination of chip in play will be removed from the table when it is no \nlonger needed in the blind or ante structure. All lower -denomination chips that are \nof sufficient quantity for a new chip will be changed up directly. The method for \nremoval of odd chips is to deal one card to a play er for each odd chip possessed. \nCards are dealt clockwise starting with the 1 -seat, with each player receiving all \nTOURNAMENTS \n44 \ncards before any cards are dealt to the next player. The player with the highest card \nby suit gets enough odd chips to exchange for one new c hip, the second -highest \ncard gets to exchange for the next chip, and so forth, until all the lower -\ndenomination chips are exchanged. A player may not be eliminated from the event \nby the chip -change process. If a player has no chips after the race has been held, \nthat player will be given a chip of the higher denomination before anyone else is \nawarded a chip. If an odd number of lower -denomination chips are left after this \nprocess, the player with the highest card remainin g will receive a new chip if having \nhalf or more of the quantity of lower-denomination chips needed, otherwise nothing. \n9. An absent player is always dealt a hand, and will be put up for blinds, antes, and \nthe forced bet if low. \n10. A player must be present at the table to stop the action by calling \u201ctime.\u201d \n11. A player must be at the table by the time all players have their complete starting \nhands in order to have a live hand for that deal. (The dealer has been instructed to \nkill the hands of all absent players immediately after dealing each player a starting \nhand.) \n12. As players are eliminated, tables are broken in a pre -set order, with players from \nthe broken tables assigned to empty seats at other tables. \n13. A change of seat is not allowed after play starts, except as assigned by the director. \n14. In button games, if a player is needed to move from a table to balance tables, the \nplayer due for the big blind will be automatically selected to move, and will be given \nthe earliest seat due for the big blind if more than one seat is open. \n15. New players are dealt in immediately and take over the obligations of that position, \nincluding the small blind or button position. \n16. The number of players at each table will be kept reasonably balanced by the \ntransfer of a player as needed. With more than six tables, table size will be kept \nwithin two players. With six tables or less, table size will be kept within one player. \n17. In all contests using three or more tables , there is a redraw for seating when the \nfield is reduced to two tables, and again to one table. \nTOURNAMENTS \n45 \n18. A player who declares all in and loses the pot, then discovers that one or more \nchips were hidden, is not entitled to benefit from this. That player is eliminated from \nthe tournament if the opponent had sufficient chips to cover the hidden ones (A \nrebuy is okay if allowable by the rules of that event). If another deal has not yet \nstarted, the director may rule the chips belong to the opponent who won that pot, if \nthat obviously would have happened with the chips out in plain view. If the next deal \nhas started, the discovered chips are removed from the tournament. \n19. If a player lacks sufficient chips for a blind or a forced bet, the player is entitled to \nget action on whatever amount of money remains. A player who posts a short blind \nand wins does not need to make up the blind. \n20. All players must leave their seat immediately after being eliminated from an event. \n21. Showing cards from a live hand during the action injures the rights of other players \nstill competing in an event, who wish to see contestants eliminated. A player may \nnot show any cards during a deal (unless the event has only two remaining \nplayers). If a player deliberately shows a card, the player may be penalized (but his \nhand will not be ruled dead). Verbally stating one\u2019s ha nd during the play may be \npenalized. \n22. The limit on raises is also applied to heads -up situations (except the last two \nplayers in a tournament are exempted from a limitation on raises). \n23. At pot -limit and no -limit play, the player must either use a ver bal statement giving \nthe amount of the raise or put the chips into the pot in a single motion. Otherwise, it \nis a string bet. \n24. Non-tournament chips are not allowed on the table. \n25. Higher-denomination chips must be placed where they are easily visible to all other \nplayers at the table. \n26. All tournament chips must remain visible on the table throughout the event. Chips \ntaken off the table or pocketed will be removed from the event, and a player who is \ncaught doing this may be disqualified. \nTOURNAMENTS \n46 \n27. Inappropriate behavior like throwing cards that go off the table may be punished \nwith a penalty such as being dealt out for a length of time. A severe infraction such \nas abusive or disruptive behavior may be punished by eviction from the tournament. \n28. The deck i s not changed on request. Decks change when the dealers change, \nunless there is a damaged card. \n29. In all tournament games using a dealer button, the starting position of the button is \ndetermined by the players drawing for the high card. \n30. The dealer button remains in position until the appropriate blinds are taken. Players \nmust post all blinds every round. Because of this, last action may be given to the \nsame player for two consecutive hands by the use of a \u201cdead button.\u201d [See \u201cSection \n16 \u2013 Explanations,\u201d discussion #1, for more information on this rule.] \n31. In heads-up play with two blinds, the small blind is on the button. \n32. At stud, if a downcard on the initial hand is dealt faceup, a misdeal is called. \n33. If a player announces the intent to rebuy before cards are dealt, that player is \nplaying behind and is obligated to make the rebuy. \n34. All hands will be turned faceup whenever a player is all -in and betting action is \ncomplete. \n35. If two (or more) players go broke during the same hand, the player starting the hand \nwith the larger amount of money finishes in the higher tournament place for prize \nmoney and any other award. \n36. Management is not required to rule on any private deals, side bets, or redistribution \nof the prize pool among finalists. \n37. Private agreements by remaining players in an event regarding distribution of the \nprize pool are not condoned. (However, if such an agreement is made, the director \nhas the option of ensuring that it is carried out by paying those amounts.) Any \nprivate ag reement that excludes one or more active competitors is improper by \ndefinition. \nTOURNAMENTS \n47 \n38. A tournament event is expected to be played until completion. A private agreement \nthat removes all prize money from being at stake in the competition is unethical. \n39. Management retains the right to cancel any event, or alter it in a manner fair to the \nplayers. \n \n48 \nSECTION 16 - EXPLANATIONS \n1. The only place in this set of rules that an alternative is mentioned other than in this \nsection is in the method of button and blind pl acement. That rule (the first rule in \n\u201cSection 4 \u2013 Button and Blind Use\u201d) is repeated below for convenience. \n\u201cEach round all participating players must get an opportunity for the button, and \nmeet the total amount of the blind obligations. Either of the fol lowing methods of \nbutton and blind placement may be designated to do this: \n \n(a) Moving button \u2013 The button always moves forward to the next player and the \nblinds adjust accordingly. There may be more than one big blind. \n(b) Dead button \u2013 The big blind is posted by the player due for it, and the small blind \nand button are positioned accordingly, even if this means the small blind or the \nbutton is placed in front of an empty seat, giving the same player the privilege of \nlast action on consecutive hands.\u201d \nPoker tradition has a lot to do with the fact that both of these methods are in \nwidespread use, but neither method is superior in all situations. The moving button \nmakes sure no player gets the advantage of last action twice on a round (a big \nadvantage at no-limit or pot-limit play). On the other hand, a player may get to post a \nblind when on the button, which is more advantageous than posting in front of the \nbutton. The moving button creates a situation where two big blinds may be posted \non a deal, which speed s up the action. At tournament play this speed -up can be \nundesirable, as when dealing is being done hand -for-hand to balance the pace of \nplay between two remaining tables. A cardroom may either decide for the sake of \nsimplicity to use only one method, or d ecide to tailor the method to the game and \nsituation. \n2. The rules given for rectifying a hold\u2019em situation where the dealer has dealt the flop \nor another boardcard before all the betting action on a round are inferior, because \nthe dealer is told to not b urn a card on a redeal. Since the \u201cno burn\u201d rule is so \ncommon, there was no choice but to use it here. But at some point it would be good \nfor poker for some major cardrooms to get together and agree to use the better rule, \nor a gaming commission to require the better rule be used. Here is the rules in \nquestion (the third rule and fourth rule in \u201cSection 5 \u2013 Hold\u2019em\u201d). \n\u201cIf the cards are prematurely flopped before the betting is complete, or if the flop \ncontains too many cards, the boardcards are mixed with t he remainder of the deck. \nThe burncard remains on the table. After shuffling, the dealer cuts the deck and \ndeals a new flop without burning a card.\u201d \n\u201cIf the dealer turns the fourth card on the board before the betting round is complete, \nthe card is taken o ut of play for that round, even if subsequent players elect to fold. \nEXPLANATIONS \n49 \nThe betting is then completed. The dealer burns and turns what would have been \nthe fifth card in the fourth card\u2019s place. After this round of betting, the dealer \nreshuffles the deck, incl uding the card that was taken out of play, but not including \nthe burncards or discards. The dealer then cuts the deck and turns the final card \nwithout burning a card. (If the fifth card is turned up prematurely, the deck is \nreshuffled and dealt in the same manner.)\u201d \nThe portion of this rule saying the dealer does not burn a card on the redeal is \nmisguided. It is much harder for the dealer to control the card to be dealt if a burn is \nrequired. The applicable sentence in the rule should read, \u201cThe dealer then cuts the \ndeck, burns a card, and turns the final card.\u201d \n3. Rule seven in \u201cSection 4 \u2013 Button and Blind Use\u201d says, \u201cA new player cannot be \ndealt in between the big blind and the button. Blinds may not be made up between \nthe big blind and the button. You mu st wait until the button passes.\u201d This rule is \nstandard practice, but allowing a new player or player making up blinds to come in \nbetween the blinds is better (if the dealer knows how to handle the resulting \nsituations), because it gets players eager to jo in or rejoin the game into action \nfaster. \n4. Most poker rule sets say you have a dead hand at the showdown if you do not have \nthe proper number of cards for that game. At stud, this rule is too strict. An \ninexperienced player sometimes does not pay suffic ient attention to the final card \nwhen holding a big hand like a flush or full house (where improvement is neither \nlikely to happen nor be needed), and fails to protect that card. If the dealer \nerroneously puts that final card into the muck after the player fails to take it in, the \nrules should give the decision -maker an option to rule such a hand live. Rule 18 in \n\u201cSection 8 \u2013 Seven-card Stud\u201d reads as below: \n\u201cA hand with more than seven cards is dead. A hand with less than seven cards at \nthe showdown is dea d, except any player missing a seventh card may have the \nhand ruled live.\u201d \n5. This rulebook requires all cash to be changed into chips. In some games this can be \na bit impractical for various reasons. If the game chooses to allow cash, only large \nbills should be permitted. \nEXPLANATIONS \n50 \n6. Most poker rulebooks follow the usual California practice in multihanded pots at limit \npoker of allowing a bet and six raises for lowball and draw high. The number of \nallowable raises for those games is given in this rulebook as a bet and three raises \nbecause this cuts down on the effect of collusion between players, and more raises \nthan three are seldom needed to define the strength of two hands when another \nplayer is calling. \n7. Lowball has historically had less stringent demands on t he order of cards or \nacceptability of exposed cards than in most other poker forms. This rulebook follows \nthe modern trend at lowball regarding misdeals of requiring the cards to be dealt \nfacedown and in proper order. \n8. At ace -to-five limit lowball, an ex posed card rule used less often, but probably a \nsuperior rule, is to not let a player take an exposed six or seven (the rule for no -limit \nace-to-five lowball). If a player gets to keep only a card that might make a perfect \nhand, having a card exposed is le ss advantageous, and the opponent must reckon \nwith the possibility of a perfect hand. \n9. At lowball and draw high, some rule sets allow a player to draw five consecutive \ncards. The rule used here disallowing this makes cheating more difficult. Our rule \n#10 in lowball and rule #5 in draw high says, \u201cA player may draw up to four \nconsecutive cards. If a player wishes to draw five new cards, four are dealt right \naway, and the fifth card after everyone else has drawn cards. If the last player \nwishes to draw five new cards, four are dealt right away, and a card is burned before \nthe player receives a fifth card.\u201d \n10. In tournament play, there are two ways the hand of an absent player may be \ntreated. Our rule #11 in \u201cSection 15 - Tournaments,\u201d is: \u201cIf you are not present when \nit becomes your turn to act, your hand is dead. This includes situations in which a \nlive blind is not present to act, since an absent player cannot exercise the option to \nraise.\u201d This speeds up play, and also prevents a player from facing situat ions like \nthinking he is moving all -in heads -up against a short stack and an absent player \ncomes back to the table to enter the pot. The alternative is: \u201cIf a player is absent, \nthe hand shall not be killed until that seat faces a wager. An absent player\u2019s hand is \ndead at the showdown.\u201d This rule gives the absent player the maximum amount of \ntime to return and be able to play the hand. \n \n51 \nGLOSSARY \nACTION: A fold, check, call, bet, or raise.
